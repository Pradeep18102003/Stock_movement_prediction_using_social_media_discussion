0,2024-09-27,131,"A definitive, verifiable GameStop update There was a comment on this sub after the most recent GameStop earnings asking:

*“With all the attention on GME, I would really appreciate hearing a factual argument about how this is a positive for shareholders and a positive for the future of the company. There seems to be a stark divide between what some people want to happen and what appears to be happening.”*

Here are some Q&A-style answers to that comment and others I’ve seen.

**Why don’t GameStop investors care that revenue is decreasing?**

This is probably the biggest misconception about the company’s outlook – the role of the legacy business.

The pre-2021 main bull case for GameStop stock was not that the company would *definitely* turn itself around, but rather that Wall Street was too eager in pegging it for bankruptcy, resulting in its low stock price. The company *was* struggling, but investors like Keith Gill believed that bankruptcy was further on the horizon, that the secular headwinds were overstated for the near-term, that the company had more time than believed to address those concerns.

Fast-forward to 2024. Bankruptcy has been all but removed from the conversation, though more so due to stock offerings as opposed to the resilience of console gaming. Even so, this still upholds the original bull thesis because now it seems they have all the time in the world to right the ship, right?

Not necessarily. The legacy business is still a liability. I say ""legacy"" because many GME investors (including Gill, per his latest stream) aren't sure physical gaming is the future for this company, but it is the current reality. The company is fine, but the business model is flawed and staring at those same secular headwinds. Therefore, the company’s revenue decrease has been attributed more to efforts to right-size those operations in order to return to profitability, thus minimizing the current business model as a liability. It comes at the expense of revenue, but that’s not as big of a concern as it would have been without the cash hoard income they’ve acquired.

**What** ***are*** **investors looking for in the earnings reports?**

More hints at what the cash reserve will be used for. No real plan laid out at this moment.

**Why doesn’t that bother you?**

From a neutral perspective, it seems reasonable to assume one of two possibilities:

* There isn’t a definitive plan for the cash at this moment.
* If there is a plan, it would likely deploy in one aggressive swoop (based on how Cohen tends to invest), so signaling beforehand may seem imprudent to the board.

PERSONALLY (re: now we’re entering into my speculative bull case), I think the timing of the cash deployment will coincide with one thing – the steadying of revenue.

It seems clear that the board is not interested in expanding into new revenue streams unless they're really sure there's no risk to profit margin, however meager. In my opinion, the moment they see that revenues AND profit are holding steady – in other words, that the legacy business is swimming on its own in its little kiddy pool – we will see cash being deployed.

That’s probably my biggest bull case for the stock in the near-term. I don’t buy that the long-term plan is T-bills for that cash hoard. Whether or not you believe Cohen is a savvy investor, one pattern is very clear – when he bets on something, it’s usually a swing for the fences. I think the market will react intensely to the news that GameStop has started deploying its cash reserves, regardless of what the cash ends up being used for.

 

I caution everyone on this sub and others to avoid dismissing the case for GameStop simply because of its intense online following. I really wish it could be talked about in more neutral terms. The reality of most discussion around it being so hyperbolic (whether negative or positive hyperbole) has made it really hard to seek out good sounding boards for discussion."
6,2024-09-27,48,"Why Healthcare stocks not popular around? I am new to stock market subs. What caught my attention is healthcare stocks are rarely discussed. I am surprised because unlike other industries:

* Healthcare companies announce product sales and regional sales numbers
* Healthcare companies clearly state if there is competition or not
* Easier to forecast because both Patent expiry date and pipeline are public information

What I like about healthcare market at large:

* Healthcare is one of three defensive industries according to Morningstar. Others are Utilities and Consumer Defensive. Utilities almost always underperform the market. For Consumer Defensive, there are huge barriers to entry. Bluechips in Beverages or Tobacco are hard to challenge. In bear market I am going to buy Utilities and Consumer Defensive; otherwise I chase Healthcare for defensive stocks and stability in my portfolio.
* The reason I go for healthcare stocks is that they possess protected downside with upside potential. It is hard to quantify the ""upside."" I try to ask healthcare professional friends of mine about the drugs.
* Another reason that I go for HC is its historical performance compared to other costs. I am sure most of you are familiar with Moore's law. Please also check Eroom's Law (that is opposite of Moore's) which applies to healthcare industry. There are countless articles about the increase in healthcare spending despite technological advancement over years. Bad news for citizens, good for investors.

>Negotiations between the union representing dockworkers and a shipping industry group representing terminal operators and ocean carriers have been stalled for months, with both sides this week issuing conflicting statements about their willingness to bargain.

>The union representing 45,000 dockworkers, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), is threatening to strike at ports from Massachusetts to Texas if a new labor deal with the USMX isn't reached before the current contract expires at midnight on September 30. A walkout would be the first East Coast dock strike since 1977. 

>The ports that could close in a strike handle more than 68% of all containerized exports in the U.S. and roughly 56% of containerized imports, according to industry data. So even a short strike would cause significant disruptions in regional trade flows. One analysis estimated that could cost the U.S. economy as much $5 billion a day.

78,2024-09-27,11,"Deep dive into Manchester United ($MANU) - Rich Men's Ego Boost **1.0 Introduction**

Back in 2012, Manchester United became a public company, at $14/share. 

Over a decade later with many ups and downs, the share price is **up disappointing 18%**. For comparison, the S&P500 is up **over 300%** during the same period, and the FTSE100 is up a bit **over 40%**.

The club’s financials continue to deteriorate, and I’m sure anyone who supports a sports club has plenty of ideas about what can be done differently.

The goal of this post is to elaborate on why the club is deteriorating (financially) and how I concluded that **sports clubs are billionaires’ toys that serve to boost their egos.**

  
**2.0 How does Manchester United (or any other sports club) make money?**

Sports clubs generally have 3 key revenue sources and here’s what the development of each one looked like for Manchester United over the last decade:

**Commercial**: £303m (vs. £189, a decade ago) - Growth of 4.8% per year

**Broadcasting**: £222m (vs. £136m a decade ago) - Growth of 5% per year

**Matchday**: £137m (vs. £108m a decade ago) - Growth of 2.4% per year



Let’s have a look at each one separately, and in each segment, try to answer the following question: ***How much is this revenue source depending on the fans?***

**2.1 Commercial revenue** consists of:

1. **Sponsorship deals** with various global and regional partners - Such as TeamViewer, the main sponsor on their shirts, but also the ones shown on the advertisement boards around the field.
2. **Merchandising, product licensing, and retail** - Club-branded merchandise, including shirts, training kits, and other apparel. It also covers licensing agreements that allow third parties to produce and sell Manchester United-branded products.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** Absolutely! The link to the merchandising and product licensing/retail segment is quite clear, but the sponsorship deals are also valued based on the exposure given to the companies. The more fans a club has, the more a company is willing to pay for its promotion.



**2.2 Broadcasting revenue** has a comparable growth, averaging **5% per year**. Apart from the revenue share of the matches (Premier League, Champions League, and other competitions), this includes MANU TV, a monthly subscription that generates over £6m per year.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** Not always, as a significant portion of it is split equally, regardless of the club and the number of fans. However, it is dependent on the success of the club and its participation in major competitions.



**2.3** **Matchday revenue** doesn’t need any introduction, although it had surprisingly low growth of \~2% per year, which is lower than the inflation rate.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** - Absolutely!



*Conclusion: All of the 3 revenue sources have very low growth, and are dependent on the two key points:*

* *The competitions the club participates in, and its success in them, and*
* *The number of fans (attending the matches, paying for MUTV, buying apparel, etc.)*

**It is safe to say that over 70% of all the revenue is derived directly from the fans.**

  
**3.0 Key expenses**

Now, let’s have a look at the key expenses and their development over time:

**Employee benefit expenses**: £365m (vs. £215, a decade ago) - Growth of 5.4% per year

**Amortization**: £190m (vs. £55m a decade ago) - Growth of 11.2% per year

**Other operating expenses**: £149m (vs. £88m a decade ago) - Growth of 5.4% per year

  
What you will notice is that **all of them have been growing at a faster pace than the revenue.** The key drivers behind this are the **larger transfer fees** and **higher salaries**. It is worth noting that the recent involvement of the Saudi clubs put even more pressure. Here's some more information about each category, for those who are interested:

**Employee benefit expenses -** The compensation of the players, managers, staff, administration, etc.

**Amortization -** Anytime a player is bought from another club, the costs associated with the acquisition of the player are capitalized, and then amortized over the duration of the contract period. For example, if a player had a £30m transfer fee, and the contract length is 3 years, there will be a £10m amortization expense per year recognized in the income statement.

**Other operating expenses -** All the other expenses, ranging from security stewarding and cleaning at Old Trafford to property costs, maintenance, HR, professional fees, etc.

  
**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**

So, if we add all of this together, the outcome is low revenue growth, with significant declining profitability. The operating margin is down from **positive 15%** to **negative 10%.** This is, after all, a very competitive environment, where no single team has been at the very top for decades in all competitions. It requires significant investments (especially in players and top management), and even then, success is not guaranteed and is temporary.

*So, you might ask:* **What is the value of a company that is not profitable, operates in a competitive field, and even success is temporary? The answer will likely be $0.**



**5.0 There is no value?**

So, is there no value? Is one of the biggest clubs in the world worthless?

I’d argue that Manchester United, like other sports clubs, aren’t valued, as there’s no significant positive free cash flow. Instead, they are being **priced**. They are in the same group as Pokemon cards, antiques, and art paintings. The beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Except, the beholders are billionaires, and they’re likely going through a checklist.

Did I buy 5 more houses? Great, check.

How about a yacht and a private jet? Yep, got it.

Damn, there’s still a lot of money left, what should I do? Oh, wait, what about a sports club?

**The owners of a sports club (in this case, the Glazer family will make money only when they sell the club to someone who is willing to pay more than they initially paid.**

  
**6.0 The emotional side**

There’s another angle that we need to explore, which is the emotional side. Some fans proudly own shares of the club, where the goal is not so much to make more money but to be a proud minority owner of the club. As such, there is nothing wrong with that.

However, there have been many examples when the stock price went up/down for ridiculous reasons. For example, there was a share price increase in 2013, due to the announcement that the club signed Fellaini. On the other side, the share price dropped \~9% on the speculation that the club might sign Ezequiel Garay. I’ll leave it up to you to decide how impactful these events are on the club’s value.

Fans will always criticize the owners/managers for the poor performance, and to a large extent, rightfully so. However, when it comes to the financial side and the share price, Manchester United is not an exception.

Take a look at the share price of Juventus, and try to guess what the spike in 2018 relates to.

If you guessed ***Cristiano Ronaldo***, well done! Don’t get me wrong. Events like this have some (minor) impact on the success of the club during a short period of time. In the case of Ronaldo, it might even bring better sponsorship deals, higher ticket prices, and more apparel sales. However, it also comes with an additional cost (his salary!). **In the long run, none of these individual events have a significant impact on the value of a football club.**

Two other football clubs that are public are Borussia Dortmund and Sporting. You can have a look at their share prices too.

**7.0 The transfer period**

Although fans are generally emotional and excited about the club they support, the transfer period is just different. There is a lot of speculation to follow, building up the expectations for the year to come.

Well, here’s how the share price changed during the transfer period (From June 10th to September 1st), in each year since the company was public.



|Year|Manchester United|S&P500|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2013|-1%|-1%|
|2014|-3%|3%|
|2015|7%|-6%|
|2016|-1%|4%|
|2017|-1%|2%|
|2018|22%|4%|
|2019|-4%|1%|
|2020|-10%|12%|
|2021|11%|7%|
|2022|11%|1%|
|2023|22%|5%|
|2024|3%|3%|
|**Total compounded return**|**64%**|**40%**|

As you can see, investing in Manchester United during the transfer period was a better decision than investing in the S&P500 during the same period. In fact, this return has been crushing the return of the stock since its IPO (which, as mentioned at the very beginning, is around a disappointing \~20%).

  
So, is this a terrible company to invest in? **Fundamentally, yes.**

Anyone who invests in Manchester United, bets that there will be a **transfer of ownership**, which will push the share price up. There were rumors for that back in February of 2023 when the share price went up almost double. Should those rumors come back, I do expect a movement of at least 60% from today’s share price.

I hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts."
205,2024-09-27,135,"'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition' * Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

0,2024-09-27,37,"What do you guys think about Palantir Tech Stock ??  Hey Reddit community,

I’ve been doing some research on Palantir Technologies (PLTR), and I’m considering investing, but I’m unsure if it’s the right move given the current market and the company’s future prospects. I’m hoping to get some insights from others who’ve been following the stock closely or have already invested.

On one hand, Palantir has seen some impressive growth recently, especially with its involvement in artificial intelligence and government contracts. They have a lot of high-profile clients, and their work in data analytics and AI seems like it could be a big part of the future. I’ve read that they’ve secured some major government and military contracts, which provides stability, but their push into the commercial sector is still a work in progress. The company’s recent earnings reports have shown decent growth, and many analysts have given it a “buy” rating, expecting it to continue rising in value over the next few years.

On the flip side, there are concerns about the company’s profitability. Despite having high revenue, Palantir has faced criticism for its high stock-based compensation, which some say dilutes shareholder value. There’s also some uncertainty about its ability to consistently grow its commercial business and rely less on government contracts. Add to that the general volatility in tech stocks right now, and I’m not sure if Palantir is a stable long-term investment or more of a speculative play. The stock has had big swings, and while some investors believe it’s poised for long-term success, others are more cautious.

So, my question is: for those of you who have been following Palantir or have invested in it, do you think now is a good time to buy, or is it too risky? Do you believe the company’s focus on AI and government contracts will keep driving its stock higher, or are there too many uncertainties in its commercial expansion and profitability?

164,2024-09-27,92,"The Chinese stock market is notching its strongest weekly gain since 2014. The CSI300 is up by 12.4% this week so far, which is its strongest weekly gain since December 2014 (+13.4%). By the end of the day, it could be strongest weekly gain since 2008. I know we hate investing in China in this sub, but there might be a point for adding a bit of China back into your portfolio today. There are two main investment theses:

1. The Chinese consumer is not financially weak, they are simply sentiment driven.
2. Chinese government support for the market is sending the signal for retail investors to invest.

**Point 1:** Context for today's environment. Chinese stock market pessimism reached peak in February 2024 as it appeared the government was not keen to provide policy support. This was a mistake in messaging by the CCP. Chinese investing culture is extremely different from the US. While US markets are more sophisticated and fundamental driven - Chinese investors are HIGHLY sentimental. Western media blames the collapse of real estate for the past 2-years of market underperformance, this is true, but not because its hurting Chinese people's financial health. It's the severing of trust in the government (that they would bail out the real estate firms and save the people's money and investment properties) that is the problem. The Chinese gross savings ratio sits at \~44%  - unlike US consumers and investors (US personal savings rate is 3%) who CAN'T spend if the market collpases, the Chinese are simply choosing not to consume or invest. 

So what does all this mean? It means the CCP needs to send the strongest possible message to the Chinese people that it will support the market and help the property industry. It doesn't actually have to do anything like a massive bailout, but it needs to be performative and convincing - like the Fed is in the US. Once sentiment swings positive, all that unallocated capital floods right back into the market - especially if it becomes a 'government-approved' medium. 

**Point 2:** And that's exactly what the CCP has done in the past week. It TELEVISED a PBOC announcement on a range of (tbh low-impact) fiscal policies. Then XJP called for an ""emergency"" politburo meeting to implement ""forceful"" rate cuts and support for real estate. They even allowed state-owned-entities (basically government fund managers) to borrow from the PBOC just to buy and prop up broad market indices. This is hugely sentiment swinging. The CCP is essentially saying to its people that ""you can invest safely, we are going to prioritise the market"", and retail is responding. 

The fact that the Chinese market might be having its strongest weekly gain since 2014 is pretty convenient because this coincides with the 2014 bubble when the Chinese government incentivised its citizens to invest in the market - a similar environment to today. What happened then:

1. The CSI almost DOUBLED between late 2014 to mid-2015. 
2. It caused one of the biggest bubbles and crashes in Chinese market history.

IMO if the market is headed for a V-shape recovery, China does not appear to be a long-term play. But there is a lot to be gained from the compressed spring that is Chinese equities rn. China Tech is arguably their strongest suite of stocks (fundamentally) and they have been going absolutely gangbusters over this week. I see strong upside over a 1-year time horizon, with downside risk being political tensions w/ US and CCP failure to follow through with policy support. I would reduce portfolio exposure approaching 2021 stock market peaks in the case of market exuberance. The ideal scenario is a slow-down or even correction to allow for more sustainable recovery. In which case, corrections represent compelling entry-points.

17,2024-09-27,59,"Rivian Stock , Buy ???  Hey everyone,

I’m considering whether or not to purchase Rivian (RIVN) stock, but I’m on the fence and would love to hear your thoughts. With Rivian’s stock dropping significantly since its IPO, I’m wondering if now might be a good time to buy in or if it’s too risky given their current challenges.

On one hand, Rivian has had some positive developments, like their partnership with Amazon to deliver electric vans and the growing interest in their R1T and R1S models. They’ve also recently secured a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen, which might help with cash flow and expansion efforts. Plus, some analysts are still giving the stock a “buy” rating, predicting a potential rebound to around $17-30 over the next year, which would be a solid return from its current price.

However, there are also a lot of red flags. The company has been burning through cash at a rapid rate, losing $1.45 billion in just one quarter this year. On top of that, they missed delivery targets last year, and competition in the EV space is fierce. Some forecasts suggest that Rivian’s stock could drop even further, to around $13 or lower by next year, or even as low as $4 by 2030 if things don’t improve.

For those who have already invested in Rivian, do you think the stock has the potential to bounce back? Or is it likely to continue struggling with production delays and competition? I’m especially interested in hearing from those who have followed the company closely—do you see any key indicators that might suggest a rebound, or is this a risky bet that could lead to bigger losses?

Would love to get your input before making a decision! Thanks!"

376,2024-09-26,167,"Costco Wholesale misses quarterly revenue estimates Costco Wholesale missed market expectations for fourth-quarter revenue on Thursday on cautious spending by budget-conscious customers at its membership-only stores, as well as an impact from lower gasoline prices.

Shares of the company were down marginally in volatile extended trading. They have gained about 37% so far this year.

While ultra-low prices on groceries and other kitchen staples is driving demand for essential products, consumer spending on big-ticket categories such as furniture, home and sporting goods has been choppy, hurting sales at Costco's warehouses.

The company's same-store sales are also taking a hit from lower gasoline prices, which squeeze their margins. They grew 5.4% in the reported period, compared with a 6.6% rise in the third quarter.

Costco reported quarterly revenue of $79.70 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $79.97 billion, according to LSEG data.

11,2024-09-26,14,"How do dividend stocks pay?  Hi all, so I'm looking to move my cash paying stocks Into dividend stocks. My portfolio is fairly balanced with my largest portion  in efts.

I'm looking at moving my S&P 500 stocks from cash to dividend paying. 

The stocks I found for dividend paying are much larger to purchase. So I could purchase 10 or so. Now if they pay dividends, does that mean the stock goes up in value? Rather than paying say 1 or a portion of a stock.

As you can't buy a portion of a stock, does this mean I'd need a much larger portfolio to start with these? Or can they pay a portion? 

Probably a simple question, but all advice I've found simply it's pays dividends back into the fund. 

I started back in 2020 slowly dip feeding my account with payments.

I'm mortgage free in 7 years. And want to get a headstand, before I up my payments after my house is secure. Aiming for 20-30 years, post mortgage. 

So long term, I would rather be in the dividend side. 

Thanks!"

715,2024-09-26,281,"Investing in Costco today is actually betting against it Costco has been the best single holding in my portfolio and after 10 years and \~1000% gains, I liquidated my holdings of Costco when it crossed $900 last week. To be clear, Costco is going to have a fantastic report today - we know this because they already release monthly sales and Costco has continued its industry leading performance, and the limited revenue growth projections of 1% are largely due to the fact that the comparable YoY quarter is a week shorter. Moreover, on an annual basis, Costco is probably one of the only companies out there that hasn't had a single losing year over the last decade. I'm also a huge Costco shopper that continues to be an addict in throwing more spend in, despite my perception that many of Costco's core staples aren't as good of a deal as they used to be. 

Revenue has improved 5%+ every year. More impressively, so has net margin, improving 50% from \~2% to 3% over the same time period. I believe the bull case that both of these trends will continue at very little risk. Costco has an amazing team to select locations and proof of international scale. It also has room to continue to steadily improve margins through its supply chain, pricing, product mix, membership price increases, and eCommerce penetration. 

But what used to be a bull case for this stock has now become bull fantasy. The arguments for Costco popping to $1000 boil down to:

1) Costco stock has always been expensive and PE doesn't matter

2) Stock split = $$$  

3) My local Costco has long lines 

Yes, Costco stock has always commanded a premium above industry. And every single quarter, every Costco bear that has said ""Costco stock is too expensive"" has been slapped in the face and proven wrong. Personally, I think Costco deserves tech-stock like valuations and a multiple of the rest of the industry. This year has been different. Costco PE ratio has eclipsed Nvidia, and is now above 55; Costco is now more expensive than it's ever been relative to its earnings by an enormous margin. For reference, if Costco instantly doubled in size right now and paid out 100% of its profits in dividends in perpetuity, it's yield would still be a little smaller than the 10Y treasury. 

A PE ratio above 50 means quite simply that you are investing in the company because you are confident earnings will explosively grow in the next few years. I am betting Costco is going to continue to be Costco - an amazingly well run company that takes almost no risk in continuing to improve over time, resulting in fantastic high single digit eps growth. The bull case now is essentially betting that Costco isn't going to be Costco, but rather something entirely different in 5 years. Those betting on Costco eclipsing $1000 after earnings today are betting that Costco will have an unprecedented pop on the quarterly report (there has never been a +10% before) and a 60+ TTM PE ratio. At some point, optimistic becomes insanity and we're there already. 

And there are downside factors to consider too. If revenue has already been largely reported, the report really centers around margin and comments on future growth. 

- 5-10% of Costco's growth has been from gold bars, which will likely be dilutive to margin (2% margin on these vs a typical 10-15%) 

- Gas prices going down isn't good for Costco

- As Costco expands it membership base, share of wallet, and portfolio of products, it becomes increasingly tied to US macroeconomic conditions simply as a function of being a more meaningful representation of total consumer spend 

- Membership price increases were smaller than some desired and haven't fully taken effect 

- Costco door scanners were likely implemented after tests proved they were accretive in the short run for margin due to improved shrinkage and folks buying more memberships; but this isn't like Netflix where each membership increase is just pure margin - the story on basket sizes, renewal impacts, and potential competitive dynamics is likely a little more murky, and will take longer to play out given annual vs. monthly renewals

- Costco lines consistently being long everywhere quarter after quarter might be a hindrance and capacity constraint vs not 

- eCommerce margins are still unclear along with the impact of Instacart on memberships"

291,2024-09-26,163,"Ubisoft Shares Sink to Decade Low After ‘Assassin’s Creed’ Delay  Ubisoft Entertainment SA shares fell to their lowest in more than a decade after the French video game company cut its outlook on weaker-than-expected sales and delayed the hotly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows.

Shares fell 19% to €9.25 at 10:27 a.m. in Paris on Thursday, the lowest since November 2013.

While Assassin’s Creed Shadows is “feature complete,” it will now debut Feb. 14 2025, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The game was initially planned for November. The company said it needed more time to improve the game after its recent Star Wars release had underperformed.

Ubisoft has over the past couple of years struggled to recover from a pandemic-era production crunch that resulted in delays in the release of new games and canceled titles. Pushing back the latest Assassin’s Creed title means it skips the lucrative holiday period.

Ubisoft said it now expects bookings of €1.95 billion ($2.2 billion) in fiscal 2025, which ends in March. Analysts were expecting €2.42 billion, on average, according to a Bloomberg survey.

Net bookings in the fiscal second quarter are now projected to be €350 million to €370 million, the company said. It previously forecast about €550 million.

The revised targets are mainly a reflection of decisions taken for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the softer-than-expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws,” Ubisoft said.

Star Wars received middling reviews after its August launch. Ubisoft said it would strive to avoid similar mistakes with Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of the holiday season.

“This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition,” according to Ubisoft. Unlike prior entries in the Assassin’s Creed series, the upcoming title will not include a Season Pass, which supplied new content in exchange for an added fee.

The latest guidance miss is Ubisoft’s fifth in six years, said analysts Doug Creutz and Mei Lun Quach from TD Cowen. The board has not held management accountable for “repeated failures in a way that serves the interest of external shareholders,” they added.

“Ubisoft has both high-quality game IP and talented developers; despite that, the last six years have been an almost non-stop parade of game delays, followed by game launches that are still undercooked, as well as misallocation of capital to games that probably never should have been green-lit in the first place,” they said.

1,2024-09-26,8,"Let's discuss - investing psychology/behavioural pitfalls that we fall into I find myself in a somewhat odd investment psychology pitfall or trap that is the opportunity cost or FOMO of potential gains, but not losses.

I have had paper losses in my investments of up to five digits are some points, which doesn't bother me emotionally or psychologically at all. However, when it comes to losing out to potential gains, it hits me with almost crippling anxiety and frustration.

For example, 

- selling off a stock after it had made a profit, to see that the price continues to appreciate shortly after,

- taking a stop loss to see that the stock makes a recovery in the very near term (immediate to say 2 weeks out),

- considering and hesitating on buying a stock, to see that it has shot up before I could come to an investment decision whether to buy.

I think what I find strange about this psychology is that I am mentally able to handle paper losses but not the ability to just shake off gains that 'could have been', even though I hadn't actually made any losses or even made smaller gains than what it potentially got to in the near future. 

I guess by writing it down, I am trying to verbalise my thoughts and emotions to make sense of it, deal with it, hopefully overcome it, and would like hear from others what goes through their minds when they are doing investments.

Do you experience any investing psychology or pitfalls yourself?

Anyone else been in a similar mental state as I am, and how did you overcome it if you did?

Additionally, broader economic risks, including deflation and a stronger dollar, exacerbate market uncertainties.

Overall, the economic data yields a score of 51 points bearish and 14 points bullish, highlighting a cautious outlook amid rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties.

241,2024-09-25,148,"Meta unveils $299 Quest 3S VR headset, Orion AR glasses prototype  Meta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company’s Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.

The device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it’ll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023′s Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple’s $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.

In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.

Meta’s previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company’s spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms.

Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple’s entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn’t revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price.

What it does

A Meta representative said the “S” in Quest 3S stands for “start” — as in getting started with VR.

Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple’s Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.

Meta highlighted improved “passthrough,” the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.

The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.

“All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,” Zuckerberg said.

In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta’s app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta’s controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn’t pressing buttons.

Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last’s year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.

Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset.

Eventually, glasses

Zuckerberg’s justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.

Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said.

Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won’t be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.

“This is where we are going,” Zuckerberg said.

Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company’s first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.

Orion is Meta’s first “fully-functioning” prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small “puck.” The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company’s 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs.

Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said.

Meta’s Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.

This isn’t the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook.

Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don’t have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company’s voice assistant.

As part of Wednesday’s event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.

For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user’s ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.

Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. 

Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. 

Those features will become available “later this year,” the company said.

The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were “a bigger hit sooner than expected.”

Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses.

AI that speaks

Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts.

With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta’s apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.

For Meta AI’s new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.

The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.

The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service.

Meta’s new chatbot features are based on the company’s AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people’s written prompts.

5,2024-09-25,0,"Amphastar (AMPH) growth potential 2025 onwards Here is full weekend analysis I completed recently. Enjoy

**DESCRIPTION**

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a vertically integrated biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing, manufacturing, and selling generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products. The company also provides insulin APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredient) used in the development of injectable finished pharmaceutical products. A key driver of Amphastar's recent performance is its acquisition of BAQSIMI®, **the first and only** nasally administered glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes.

**Executive Summary**

Amphastar continues to leverage its technical expertise in complex generics and proprietary products. The company announced net revenues of $644.4 million for 2023, a substantial increase from $499.0 million in 2022. Similarly, financial results for the second quarter of 2024 are similarly strong, with net revenues growing to $182.4 million, a 25% increase from the prior year. The recent acquisition of BAQSIMI® and the company’s expanding product line signal continued growth.

Amphastar is well-positioned to capitalize on its diverse portfolio of over 25 commercial products, robust pipeline, and growing manufacturing capabilities. While the company's recent acquisitions, such as BAQSIMI®, and its focus on niche markets have strengthened its position in the injectable and inhalation markets, further developments and successful integration of these strategic moves will be crucial in determining its leadership in these sectors.

**Market At Large**

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals falls under the pharmaceuticals industry and can be classified as a drug manufacturer that specializes in both specialty pharmaceuticals and generic drugs.

The pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow significantly, driven by an aging population, and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes. The U.S. injectable drug market was valued at $340 billion in 2023, with Amphastar targeting over $11 billion in opportunities within the space. Additionally, the U.S. inhalation market is valued at $29 billion, where Amphastar’s Primatene MIST® has captured significant market share. The injectable drug market alone is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 8% in the next decade.

Research supports the findings in annual reports. Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S. In 2022, published by Parker et al. on November 1st, 2023, stated that In 2022, the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. was $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs and $106.3 billion in indirect costs attributable to diabetes. For the cost categories analyzed, 1 in 4 health care dollars spent in the U.S. is related to the care of individuals diagnosed with diabetes, with 61% of these costs being directly attributable to diabetes.

Amphastar is well-positioned to capture a share of this growing market due to its focus on diabetes-related products, particularly with its acquisition of BAQSIMI®. With diabetes care accounting for such a significant portion of healthcare spending, Amphastar’s expanding presence in this space provides a substantial growth opportunity.

**Company & Business Description**

Amphastar’s diversified product line includes injectable, intranasal, and inhalation products. Its portfolio spans over 25 marketed products, including Primatene MIST®, BAQSIMI®, Glucagon for Injection, and REXTOVYTM. The company’s pipeline includes over 20 product candidates, many of which leverage Amphastar’s core strengths in drug delivery technology, particle engineering, and API manufacturing.

Amphastar’s business model includes both selling proprietary products and manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which are sold to other pharmaceutical companies.

Key strengths include its vertically integrated infrastructure, which enables the company to oversee all stages of product development from research through commercialization. Amphastar's international expansion is highlighted by the acquisition of BAQSIMI®, which is sold in 27 countries.

**Management**

Jack Y. Zhang, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, has led the company since 1996. With over 35 years of experience in chemistry and management, Dr. Zhang has driven Amphastar’s growth through his deep technical expertise and leadership. He holds several patents and a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Founder-led businesses like Amphastar often outperform peers due to the founder’s personal stake, long-term vision, and deep understanding of the company. Dr. Zhang’s leadership, combining scientific knowledge and operational management, is a key driver of Amphastar’s success.

**Financial Statements**

Amphastar’s financial performance in 2023 was marked by strong revenue growth and profitability. Total net revenues were $644.4 million, with a gross margin of 49.7%. The company’s net income reached $137.5 million, a significant increase from $91.4 million in 2022.

For Q2 2024, Amphastar reported total revenues of $182.4 million, a 25% increase from the same period in 2023. Gross profit also saw a substantial rise to $95.2 million, representing a 31% gross margin, up from $72.7 million a year ago. This was mainly driven by the growth in the sale of BAQSIMI® and Primatene MIST® along with robust performance from its insulin API business.

The company’s balance sheet remains solid, with cash and equivalents of $189.6 million as of June 30, 2024. Amphastar can comfortably cover its current liabilities, but the company has significant long-term debt primarily due to the acquisition of BAQSIMI®. While the company has been actively managing its debt, the liquidity position is still strong, allowing Amphastar to invest in R&D and consider further strategic acquisitions or product development.

Amphastar’s retained earnings grew significantly, reaching $490.4 million as of June 30, 2024, up from $409.3 million at the end of 2023. This is is a positive indicator of profitability and financial health.

Amphastar has $255.8 million in treasury stock, up from $247.4 million at the end of 2023. This increase reflects the company’s continued buyback activity, demonstrating confidence in its own stock and a commitment to enhancing shareholder value by reducing the outstanding share count.

The company reported -$24.3 million in net cash used in financing activities for the first half of 2024. Despite not issuing new shares, Amphastar made debt-related payments (including principal repayments on long-term debt), engaged in share buybacks, and made equity plan payments. The absence of new common share issuance can be a positive signal for investors, as it shows the company is not diluting existing shareholders, and the continued share repurchases signal management’s confidence in the company's future.

**BAQSIMI® Acquisition**

BAQSIMI® (glucagon), a dry nasal spray used in an emergency for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes ages four years and above, is the first and only nasally administered glucagon. It is compact, portable and ready to use in a single, fixed 3mg dose.

On June 30, 2023, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals completed the acquisition of BAQSIMI® from Eli Lilly & Company. The total deal value was $628.1 million, including a $500 million upfront cash payment, deferred payments, and potential contingent payments of up to $450 million based on sales milestones:

1. *$100 million*: If annual net sales of BAQSIMI® and related products reach $175 million within the first five years after acquisition.
2. *Two payments of $100 million each*: If annual net sales reach $200 million in any year during the same period.
3. *$150 million*: If cumulative net sales of $950 million are achieved within the first five years.

In addition, the company entered into agreements with Lilly to ensure a smooth transition, including a Manufacturing Services Agreement for continued production and a Transition Services Agreement to support clinical and commercial operations for up to 18 months.

BAQSIMI® strengthens Amphastar’s position in the diabetes care market, providing immediate revenue growth and expanding the company’s global footprint into 27 countries. The company expects BAQSIMI® to generate substantial long-term value, with a product lifespan of 24 years.

The deal was funded through a $700 million credit facility, demonstrating the company’s financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities.

**BAQSIMI® Sales 2021-2024**

The sales data for BAQSIMI® has been sourced from both Eli Lilly and Amphastar’s annual and quarterly reports. 

Noteworthy points include:

* 2022 Full Year: BAQSIMI® generated $252.7 million in total sales, with $207 million coming from the U.S. and $45.7 million from international markets.
* 2023 Q2: Eli Lilly reported a significant sales surge of $613.9 million as the company worked to deplete its inventory following the announcement of BAQSIMI®'s sale to Amphastar.
* 2023 Full Year: Total sales for BAQSIMI® amounted to $746.4 million.
* 2024 H1: Sales slowed, totaling $61.9 million by mid-year, likely reflecting transitional factors associated with the Manufacturing and Transition Services Agreements between Eli Lilly and Amphastar.

This data highlights the fluctuations in BAQSIMI® sales leading up to its full transfer to Amphastar in 2025, where a more consistent growth trajectory is expected.

**Future Outlook**

Total revenues from finished pharmaceutical products for 2023, 2022, and 2021 amounted to $579.1 million, $486.5 million and $419.6 million, respectively. This is significant as it forms the baseline revenue for Amphastar's core business.

Amphastar’s acquisition of BAQSIMI® from Eli Lilly is expected to significantly boost its revenue starting in 2025, once the company takes over the manufacturing and direct sales. Prior to Amphastar's control, Eli Lilly's inventory depletion efforts in 2023 Q2 led to an extraordinary $613.9 million in total BAQSIMI® sales. However, the drop in sales afterward reflects a period where Eli Lilly’s sales incentives waned due to the transitional agreements, resulting in lower sales during 2023 H2 and 2024 H1.

**Once Amphastar assumes full control in 2025 Q1, the alignment of sales incentives will likely restore BAQSIMI’s growth trajectory.**

BAQSIMI®’s future potential is substantial, particularly as the glucagon market grows and Amphastar expands all its products internationally, especially in China and Europe. This acquisition aligns with Amphastar's long-term strategy of expanding its branded product portfolio, improving operational efficiencies, and capturing high-margin niche markets.

**Valuation**

Given Amphastar's current P/E of 15.30 and forward P/E of 17x based on 2024 estimates. I disagree with analysts on that because BAQSIMI® is likely to be accretive to earnings starting from 2025 more than expected.

My Sales Scenarios for 2025-2029:

1. Moderate Growth Scenario:

Amphastar steadily grows BAQSIMI® sales from $200 million in 2025 to $400 million by 2029.

Existing products grow at a stable rate of around 5% year-over-year, starting from $579.1 million in 2023.

Total Projected Revenue by 2029:

BAQSIMI®: $400 million

Existing products: \~$730 million

Total Revenue: $1.13 billion

2) Optimistic Growth Scenario:

BAQSIMI® hits $250 million in 2025 and reaches $500 million by 2029.

Existing products maintain a similar growth trajectory.

Total Projected Revenue by 2029:

BAQSIMI®: $500 million

Existing products: \~$730 million

Total Revenue: $1.23 billion

3) Aggressive Growth Scenario:

BAQSIMI® reaches $300 million by 2025 and $700 million by 2029, reflecting the higher sales potential.

Existing product revenues remain steady, growing alongside BAQSIMI®.

Total Projected Revenue by 2029:

BAQSIMI®: $700 million

Existing products: \~$730 million

Total Revenue: $1.43 billion

Rationale:

* **Existing Product Sales**: Amphastar’s diversified product portfolio is generating strong and stable revenues. This provides a solid foundation for the company’s future growth.
* **BAQSIMI® Contribution**: Given its potential as a high-margin product, BAQSIMI® will accelerate Amphastar’s revenue growth and drive profitability once manufacturing and sales incentives are aligned in 2025.
* **Synergies**: The company’s strategy of expanding its branded portfolio and increasing its presence in niche markets supports its premium valuation, especially with BAQSIMI®’s global market potential.

Amphastar’s diversification into proprietary products, combined with its ability to navigate regulatory processes and execute complex acquisitions, adds a premium to its valuation.

If Amphastar can achieve the optimistic or aggressive revenue growth projections, along with corresponding improvements in profitability, it is likely that the market will recognize this performance by significantly re-rating the stock. Companies that demonstrate sustained top-line and bottom-line growth, particularly in high-margin, high-demand segments, often command higher valuation multiples. In such cases, it would not be unusual for Amphastar to enjoy a P/E ratio of 30 or higher, in line with other high-growth pharmaceutical companies that successfully capitalize on niche market leadership and product innovation.

**Risks**

* **Supply Chain Constraints**: Amphastar relies on single-source suppliers for key raw materials, especially for complex products like BAQSIMI®. Any disruptions could impact production and sales, particularly during the transition post-acquisition.
* **Price Sensitivity**: Pricing pressures from healthcare reforms and competition, including biosimilars, could affect margins. Maintaining BAQSIMI®'s profitability in a competitive market will be essential.
* **Geopolitical Risks**: The company’s operations in China are vulnerable to geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions, which could affect manufacturing and supply chain stability.
* **Competitive Pressure**: Increased competition from larger pharmaceutical companies could erode market share, especially in glucagon products like BAQSIMI®.
* **Regulatory Risks**: Delays in regulatory approvals for new products and BAQSIMI®’s integration in international markets could impact sales timelines.
* **Acquisition Integration**: Smooth integration of BAQSIMI® post-transition is critical to achieving projected sales growth. Any delays could hinder short-term performance.

**CATALYSTS**

* **Successful integration and ramp-up of BAQSIMI®:** With BAQSIMI® expected to significantly contribute to revenues post-2025, its integration and performance under Amphastar’s management will be critical.
* **REXTOVY™ approval and commercial launch:** The rollout of this naloxone nasal spray product will diversify Amphastar’s emergency treatment offerings and strengthen its foothold in opioid overdose treatments.
* **Expansion of Primatene MIST® and insulin biosimilars:** Continued growth in these key product lines, along with new biosimilars in the pipeline, will drive future revenue streams and enhance market penetration.
* **Strategic international expansion through BAQSIMI® channels:** Amphastar’s ability to leverage BAQSIMI®’s established presence in over 27 countries will be instrumental in accelerating international growth.
* **Ongoing share repurchases:** The company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders through stock buybacks will further enhance investor confidence."
88,2024-09-25,40,"Google files EU antitrust complaint accusing Microsoft of stifling cloud competition  Google filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission on Wednesday accusing Microsoft of using unfair licensing contracts to stifle competition in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing industry.

At the heart of Google’s complaint is the allegation that Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to “lock in” clients and exert control over the cloud market.

Google alleges that Microsoft, through its dominant Windows Server and Microsoft Office products, can make it difficult for its massive roster of clients to use anything but its Azure cloud infrastructure offering.

The internet giant said in its complaint that restrictions contained in Microsoft’s cloud licensing terms makes it harder for customers to move their workloads from Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to competitors’ clouds, despite there being no technical barriers to doing so.

European businesses and public sector organizations have been forced to pay the firm up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year in licensing penalties due to restrictions on customers’ ability to switch from one cloud provider to another, Google said, citing a 2023 study by CISPE, a trade body for the cloud computing sector.

The antitrust complaint from Google arrives after CISPE and its members in July agreed a settlement with Microsoft which would see the firm make changes to address competition concerns.

Referring to the CISPE settlement, Microsoft said in a statement Wednesday that it expects the European Commission to dismiss Google’s complaint.

“Microsoft settled amicably similar concerns raised by European cloud providers, even after Google hoped they would keep litigating,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. “Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission.”

Microsoft’s cloud ‘tax’ at issue

In a summary of the complaint, Google — which ranks third globally in the cloud computing market behind market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, respectively — said that Microsoft “harms cybersecurity and undermines innovation.”

According to Google, if a company runs Microsoft’s Office suite of productivity tools and other applications on Google Cloud Platform or other competing clouds, they are effectively required to pay a “tax” in the form of punchy licensing fees to Microsoft.

Google said that Microsoft undermined competition in cloud, and referred to findings of a U.K. Competition and Markets Authority study which determined Microsoft acquired over 60% to 70% of all new British businesses in 2021 and 2022.

Google also suggested that Microsoft’s cloud practices have potentially made businesses more prone to security issues.

In an interview with CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal Wednesday, Amit Zavery, Google Cloud’s head of platform, said Google believes Microsoft is “100%” in violation of EU antitrust rules.

“We would like the cloud market to remain and become very vibrant and open for all the providers including European vendors, vendors like us, AWS and others,” Zavery said.

“Today the restrictions does not allow choice for customers,” Zavery said. “Today the restrictions does not allow choice for customers,” he said, adding that Microsoft included restrictions once it realized the massive commercial potential of the technology.

“So, we would want those restrictions to be removed and allow customers to have and choose whatever cloud provider they think is best for them commercially and technically,” he added.

Zavery told CNBC that if Microsoft makes changes to its cloud licensing terms as a result of its complaint, Google and cloud customers more broadly would be “very happy.”

Following the July settlement agreement with Microsoft, CISPE said the tech giant would work with its members to release an enhanced version of Azure Stack HCI, a cloud infrastructure product, to offer the same features that Microsoft customers using its Azure product currently benefit from.

Google, which is not a CISPE member, said it disagreed with the settlement and chose not to participate in the agreement. Amazon Web Services, which is a CISPE member, and Alibaba’s cloud unit AliCloud, also chose not to become part of the settlement.

For its part, Microsoft has denied that its cloud practices harm competition. In response to a cloud market study initiated by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority, the firm said that it “firmly believes that the cloud services market is functioning well.”

1388,2024-09-25,283,"Boeing losing '$100 million to $150 million a day' as union strike rolls on Boeing (BA) finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place as the labor strike between it and the International Association of Machinists (IAM) union nears a second week.

On Monday, Boeing upped its offer to the union, which represents 33,000 workers, but did not proceed through union leadership and instead sent a ""best and final"" offer directly to workers, which didn’t sit well with the IAM. Boeing’s latest offer upped pay hikes to 30% from 25% in the prior offer, doubled a signing bonus to $6,000, and increased 401(k) contributions, among other things.

""The survey results from yesterday were overwhelmingly clear, almost as loud as the first offer: members are not interested in the company's latest offer that was sent through the media,"" IAM said in a statement late Tuesday night. ""Many comments expressed that the offer was inadequate and the company's decision to bypass the Union was viewed as disrespectful.""

Earlier, IAM said it contacted Boeing to engage in “direct talks” after the offer, which the company refused. Therefore, the union said it would not be holding a vote on the proposal.

Nevertheless, Boeing’s insistence on going directly to union members speaks to the difficulty the company is in, said Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and tourism expert at consulting firm AM&A.

IAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a “very strong position,” Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a “reputational level” too.

With the strike hitting Boeing’s bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.

Shareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October.

“Boeing is already having to do some significant re-examination of the financials of the organization. To put this in context, every single day that Boeing is on strike, they’re losing between $100 million and $150 million,” Mendiratta said to Yahoo Finance.

Without union workers based in Boeing’s Renton, Wash., assembly facility, Boeing cannot deliver its 737 Max jets, which are the company’s cash cow. Boeing is still able to deliver its 787 Dreamliner out of its non-union South Carolina facility; however, those jets are limited in number. In the second quarter, Boeing delivered 70 737 Max jets, but only nine of the larger Dreamliners.

Mendiratta, who is also special adviser to the UN Tourism Secretary-General, said disruptions in Boeing not only hurt the American plane maker but also the aviation industry as a whole.

“It’s not just Boeing that’s in trouble — the entire global aviation system is in trouble because it relies on Boeing for 4 in 10 commercial aircraft as well as what it delivers in its other divisions,” Mendiratta said. “When there is a delay in the delivery of aircraft, and there are many airlines that are having delays, it means that the entire global aviation ecosystem is going to suffer, as is the global traveling public.”

Mendiratta doesn’t see the union bending here, at least not in the short term. Boeing put workers in a difficult position that led them to strike in the first place, she said, and emotions are running high following Boeing’s latest move to circumvent IAM leadership.

IAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a “very strong position,” Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a “reputational level” too.

With the strike hitting Boeing’s bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.

Shareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October.

The biggest one was in 2021, when it was revealed that Okta employees could access customer data from their home laptops. Then LAPSUS wrote that they had gained access to Okta’s systems and could change passwords. For me, this is where Okta's ended.

DoJ to allege Visa monopolized U.S. debit card market - report

Sept 24 (Reuters) - Visa (V.N), opens new tab shares fell 3% on Tuesday after a report said the U.S. Department of Justice plans to file a lawsuit against the world's largest payment processor, alleging it illegally monopolized the country's debit-card market.

The antitrust division of the regulator is set to file a lawsuit as soon as Tuesday, accusing Visa of a range of anti-competitive conduct, Bloomberg News reported, opens new tabon Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

""We believe this is an immediate negative to shares but we caution these types of antitrust cases are notoriously known for long/winding paths in the U.S.,"" boutique equity research firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co said.
Visa did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

FRESH ANTITRUST SCRUTINY

The company has been facing heightened scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers for years, battling allegations of a duopoly with Mastercard (MA.N), opens new tab . Both companies say they operate in a highly competitive environment.
""The concern appears to be that Visa is using volume-based discounts to discourage merchants from diverting debit volume to other networks,"" brokerage TD Cowen said.

""It appears to us that Justice needs to argue that Visa providing discounts creates a barrier to entry for new rivals that could have driven down pricing even more.""

News of the potential lawsuit comes months after another major legal setback for the duo, when a judge rejected a $30 billion antitrust settlement under which Visa and Mastercard had agreed to limit the fees they charge merchants that accept their credit and debit cards.
Brokerage KBW estimated that the U.S. debit business likely represents 10% of Visa revenues at the high end. It said the potential lawsuit is unlikely to be material in the long-term but expects a prolonged road to resolution.
The prudent course of action for Visa would be to wait until the November election to ""see the intentions of the next administration,"" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of personal finance firm WalletHub.

""If the next administration's intentions are anything similar to the current one, the goal should be to settle instead of fighting a legal battle. There is a lot of uncertainty when you have protracted court battles, especially against the government.""

Mastercard shares fell 1% in morning trade. Both stocks have underperformed broader markets this year, gaining 11% and 16.5% respectively, compared with the S&P 500's (.SPX), opens new tab near 20% gain.

Essentially, I'm wondering if call options are doing anything more than simulating the purchase of 100 shares.  (plus a premium that you pay for it)

9,2024-09-24,13,"Clear Secure (YOU) Stock analysis. what do you think about the company? Clear Secure (YOU), Stock analysis  (i dont own any shares of clear)

  

Is a biometric security company which means it produces eye and fingerprint scanners but clear secure markets them skillfully. At airports there are extra clear booths where you can confirm your identity via scanner if you have a clear plus membership and thus skip the line for normal government identity confirmation at the airport.  

  

Clear secure benefits:  

  

Clear secure benefits from unorganized airports by offering a short queue with which you can get identified by eye scan and thus do not have to wait the normal often long waiting time.   

  

Identity checks at airports are already overloaded with queues sometimes hours long and every year more people will travel and fly so it may be worthwhile for people who travel often to buy a Clear plus membership.  

  

So far, clear scanners are only available at 60 airports in the US, so they have a long way to go to expand  

  

Even though their offer is very expensive (199 dollars per year) and only worth it for people who fly 5 times or more per year, you can get it cheaper with credit cards or other offers, for example with tsa precheck in the offer.   

  

clear secure is also partnering with tsa precheck so in the future they can also take over the check-in of tsa precheck subscribers on behalf of tsa precheck which can be a good way to market clear plus and also shows a good cooperation between clear secure and the government.  

  

For the airports, clear secure is also a win because it brings in a lot of money and with decreasing parking revenue, the airports can replace other revenue streams that are getting lower.  

  

Their scan technology can also be used in various locations such as stadiums, offices, stands, etc. they have created a kind of ecosystem with the aim that in the future you can identify yourself everywhere with your face via clear secure and confirm your data such as age identity and vaccination status. other possible locations would be healthcare, clubs casinos etc. so far clear is already active in several stadiums and interesting partnerships are perhaps those with LinkedIn at LinkedIn you can log into your account via clear secure scan for a year now. You can also register at home depot locations using clear secure. what is interesting here is the way in which the manegment is introducing clear secure in different areas, which shows how many places you can use clear scan technology  

  

clear's ceo has been ceo since 2010 and she initiated all the things that make clear the company it is today  

  

Another interesting point is that clear secure has no direct competitors in this type of business other companies that also sell biometric security services such as facial iris and fingerprint scans serve the us government for example IDEMIA and Thales Group also help with their scans at border control or help with tsa checks at the airport they sell to the government but only the technology.  

  

while clear secure pioneered a commercialized customer-facing system with purchasable premium memberships and stand-alone queues at the airport.   

  

As for the clear plus membership retention rate, last year in Q2 it was 90% and has dropped to 80% this year due to a price increase. of course i hope that this trend will not continue but i assume that in the future the retention rate will remain between 80-90%.  

  

Price increases are nothing unusual for Clear but since 2010 the price of the clear plus membership has only been increased twice while the product has grown from two extra lines to 60 extra lines. this year clear has also added a perk to the celar plus membership. there are some discounts for third party services through the membership and there is also a free search service that you can call if you realize you have forgotten or lost something at the airport and they will look it up on their own or help you find it. These perks are nothing earth-shattering, but they at least increase the value of your membership  

  

Balance sheet or income statement related:  

  

Since 2019 they have tripled the revenue from 192 million to 697 million even if I don't expect such a rapid growth Clear can still grow for many years with an annual growth rate of 10-20% as they still have many easy expansion opportunities and their market cap is only 3 billion  

  

Clear has no debt on the balance sheet  

  

  

Clear has a fcf margin of 38% and even though they have issued 2.5% shares this year, 11.5% last year and 7.27% the year before last, now that they are so profitable they want to go other ways and buy back shares. in the earnings call the cfo also said that they are doing this because they want to be shareholder friendly in the long term.  

  

Even if they have done so much equity funding in the last few years, at least their cash flow has grown faster, which is why their fcf per share has grown by an average of 30 percent in the last three years.  

  

Clear secure disadvantages:  

  

One disadvantage that Clear secure definitely has is pricing their premium membership costs 199 dollars per year, if you look at platforms like reddit or trustpilot one reason for the one star rating is that it is expensive and not worth the price.  

  

or normal consumers this is true even if you assume that the average family flies maybe twice a year it is not worth it for them because that 199 dollars is also a larger percentage of their annual income. This definitely limits clear secures customer base to wealthier people who would just do anything at the airport to make it go faster or maybe people who have to fly very often due to their job so their cost per use is so low that it's worth it  

  

Another concern started with a case in 2022 in which a man who wanted to smuggle ammunition despite a false identity tricked such a clear secure scanner, which of course caused the share price to fall sharply and also with a reason: if the machines are not 100% secure, you don't need them. Clear Secure responded quickly with a new system that scans not only the eyes and fingerprints but also the face, assuring clear secure that they are 100% secure even though no major case has happened since then and face scanning is also relatively secure, clear secure is of course now subject to stricter controls and if such a case happens again, clear secure could be punished more severely.  

  

Another threat is that airports could become more efficient so that a costly overhaul line like clear is no longer needed as mentioned earlier many biometric security companies sell their technology to the government and with enough of these scanners equipped the queues should not be that long. Firstly, of course we don't know what the future holds, but airports have always been completely overcrowded during the peak travel times and I don't see that changing  

  

The last and I think also one of the strongest contra points against investing in clear secure is:  

  

in the end, clear secure at airports (their main buisness) is an overtaking rod for those who want to afford it and that is of course a thorn in the side of every people-oriented politician.   

  

airports are financed by tax money and so instead of offering clear secure for the money, they should make the airport more efficient in general. but if an airport earns millions a year from its clear secure line, why should it do that? For the population that can't afford clear secure, that's obviously bad.  

  

In addition, according to some, the state should not hand over its security processes to private companies, but as far as that is concerned, I don't believe that clear secure lines will be abolished by airports in the future either. clear secure works closely with the state programs tsa and tsa precheck, as I said, in the future clear staff will be able to check in tsa precheck members and there are already lines in cooperation with tsa precheck that combine the two advantages so that there is a clear plus + tsa precheck line at several airports.  

  

Voluation:  

  

Clear secure PE ratio is 42 and the P/FCF ratio is 11, this big difference is due to the fact that clear secure has become profitable very quickly in the last few years in terms of free cash flow and the net income margin is not quite there yet while the FCF margin is just at 38% the net income margin is still at 10% stock based compensation is also not really meaningful that it would make such a difference.  

  

In the future, the FCF margin should in any case remain between 40% and 30% and the net income margin should also move up to 30%.  

  

Conclusion  

  

I am actually interested in the company and could also imagine opening a clear secur position in the future, as I expect a long period of sales growth and the risk factors outweigh the positive aspects.   

  

At the moment I have not yet bought any shares  "

Still I'm curious, what will you be doing? Nothing/waiting? Selling? Buying more...? What do you expect will happen?"

 I was looking at the balance sheet of apple in a video I was watching and it showed that apples equity has been going down a lot from 2017 to 2021 .When they looked closer at the equity statements they concluded that it was because they were doing large share buybacks, so cash was used to buy the stock ie assets were reduced as cash is an asset.

However even though cash was used to buyback stocks , the stock in itself is also an asset and the price of apple stock has only gone up from 2017 to 2021 so this should more than counteract the effect of assets reduction due to cash being used to buy back shares and thus equity really shouldn't have changed significantly because of that ."

IWM small cap because of rate cuts, SCHD because it has under performed compared to some other etfs.. same about IWM.. so buying on a discount relative to SPY and QQQM.  Rate cuts should help small cap.  Buying SCHD when it hasn’t grown as fast as SPY so hopefully getting dividend stocks to keep at a lower price anticipating SCHD to go up.  This also reduces the exposure to tech compared to just SPY /QQQM .. or a 25%, 25%,25%,25% allocation to SPY, SCHD,IWM, QQQM by about 6% because tech has ran so huge.. it has to slow down at some point…I also want to get more real estate as it is only 2.8 % but I’ll work on that with a few hand picked ones probably.  This 30,30,20,20 split also slightly increases financials, and industrials which as I understand should preform better in a rate cut environment.

This is what I come up with I’m my research and how I think may be a good way to play it. 

Please give me your honest thoughts.  

Also I am expecting the market will go down some until the election so I will keep a lot of cash on the side..dca into these once a week with a little under half what I plan on putting into it between now and the election… the remaining amount I will be taking advantage of any drops in any of these etfs… which will undoubtedly throw my percentages off which is ok.. I will allow any of them to vary within reason.. if any start to get to much I’ll cut back.. or if any get to little I’ll put more into it.. 

Ty and if this looks a little higher on risk.. I am ok with that because I am hoping for more risk more reward.. without being to risky

Citing recent data on consumer and producer prices, Waller told CNBC that the data is showing core inflation, excluding food and energy, in the Fed’s preferred measure is running below 1.8% over the past four months. The Fed targets annual inflation at 2%.

“That is what put me back a bit to say, wow, inflation is softening much faster than I thought it was going to, and that is what put me over the edge to say, look, I think 50 [basis points] is the right thing to do,” Waller said during an interview with CNBC’s Steve Liesman.

Both the consumer and producer price indexes showed increases of 0.2% for the month. On a 12-month basis, the CPI ran at a 2.5% rate.

However, Waller said the more recent data has shown an even stronger trend lower, thus giving the Fed space to ease more as it shifts its focus to supporting the softening labor market.

A week before the Fed meeting, markets were overwhelmingly pricing in a 25 basis point cut. A basis point equals 0.01%.

“The point is, we do have room to move, and that is what the committee is signaling,” he said."

Please correct/ comment on plain math below.

PLTR is 82B market cap, soon to be included in SP-500 index. I don't know how many trillions are parked in this index, via funds and ETFs, but that should at least be $9T.

As of 2021, this number was $5.4T

[https://www.axios.com/2021/07/07/sp-500-index-funds-record](https://www.axios.com/2021/07/07/sp-500-index-funds-record)

Today, just the top 5 index ETFs from Vanguard, Schwab, Fidelity, give a total of over $3T.

So, just 0.1% weight in SP-500 would mean inflows of $9B to a company. Since PLTR's market cap today is close to $82B, doesn't this mean, an obvious 9% jump when ETFs and funds *have to* buy this stock?"

76,2024-09-20,94,"Inflation moving sustainably to 2% Got an economics question for you all.  Sounds like Powell is satisfied with inflation moving sustainably to 2%, and was apparently (at least on the surface) so thrilled by that progress that he cut rates 0.5%.  

However, looking at core CPI, it appears to still be stuck above 3%.  https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/united-states-core-inflation-rates/

Granted, headline CPI is more like 2.5%, but that factors in energy, which is notoriously volatile.  All we need is some nasty war, and oil can spike like it did in 2022.  For that reason, I had understood that core CPI is usually considered more reliable.

Finally, I understand that the Fed prefers core PCE, and the difference there with core CPI is unclear.  Anyway, core PCE has been stuck at 2.6% for months too.
https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/core-pce-price-index-905/

That is, no further progress seems to be made, and Core PCE still seems considerably higher than the pre-2021 numbers, which were more in the 1.5% to 2.0% range even before the COVID disruptions.


What are your thoughts on this inflation situation?  (I am not referring to whether you think the stock market will go up or down, but more whether you agree with Powell that inflation is tamed, or if I am missing something key about the trajectory of inflation.)

360,2024-09-20,63,"FTC sues drug middlemen (UNH, CVS, CI) for allegedly inflating insulin prices https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/ftc-sues-drug-middlemen-for-allegedly-inflating-insulin-prices.html

> The Federal Trade Commission on Friday sued three large U.S. health companies that negotiate insulin prices, arguing the drug middlemen boost their profits while “artificially” inflating costs for patients.  The suit targets the three biggest so-called pharmacy benefit managers, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum Rx, CVS Health’s
 Caremark and Cigna’s Express Scripts. All are owned by or connected to health insurers and collectively administer about 80% of the nation’s prescriptions, according to the FTC.  The FTC’s lawsuit also includes each PBM’s affiliated group purchasing organization, which brokers drug purchases for hospitals and other health-care providers. PBMs sit at the center of the drug supply chain in the U.S. They negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, large employers and federal health plans. They also create lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburse pharmacies for prescriptions. The FTC has been investigating PBMs since 2022. 

> The agency’s suit argues that the three PBMs have created a “perverse” drug rebate system that prioritizes high rebates from drugmakers, which leads to “artificially inflated insulin list prices.” It also alleges that PBMs favor those high-list-price insulins even when more affordable insulins with lower list prices become available.  “Millions of Americans with diabetes need insulin to survive, yet for many of these vulnerable patients, their insulin drug costs have skyrocketed over the past decade thanks in part to powerful PBMs and their greed,” Rahul Rao, deputy director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.  “The FTC’s administrative action seeks to put an end to the Big Three PBMs’ exploitative conduct and marks an important step in fixing a broken system—a fix that could ripple beyond the insulin market and restore healthy competition to drive down drug prices for consumers,” Rao continued. 

> The FTC said it also remains “deeply troubled” by the role insulin manufacturers like Eli Lilly, Danish company Novo Nordisk and French drugmaker Sanofi  play in higher list prices, according to a release from the agency. The three companies control roughly 90% of the U.S. insulin market."

The other driver for the steep drop in their shareprice was the debt refinancing that will take place in 2026.

0,2024-09-20,31,"NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Financial Round Tripping | Thematics # Background

It's crucial to understand the concept of financial round-tripping and its implications for the market. Round-tripping is a deceptive practice that has gained notoriety in recent years due to its potential to mislead investors and manipulate financial statements. This fraudulent technique involves creating artificial transactions between two or more entities to inflate revenues, evade taxes, or present a false picture of financial health.

Typically, round-tripping occurs when a company sells an asset to another entity while simultaneously agreeing to buy back the same or a similar asset at approximately the same price. This creates the illusion of bustling business activity and growth, which can be particularly attractive to speculative investors. However, these transactions lack genuine economic substance and violate the fundamental accounting principle of substance over form. Round-tripping has been implicated in several high-profile financial scandals, including those involving energy traders like Enron and CMS Energy, as well as financial service providers such as Wirecard. As an investment advisor, it's essential to be vigilant and look for red flags that might indicate round-tripping, such as unusually high revenue growth without corresponding increases in cash flow or profit margins.

**The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping**. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion.

# History of Financial Round Tripping in Tech

 Over the past 20 years, several high-profile cases of round-tripping have emerged in the technology sector, highlighting the prevalence of this deceptive practice. Here are some notable examples:

# Enron Scandal (2001)

While not strictly a tech company, Enron's collapse involved significant round-tripping in energy trading. The company engaged in numerous sham transactions with special purpose entities to inflate revenues and hide debt. These transactions involved selling assets to these entities and then buying them back at similar prices, creating the illusion of bustling business activity.

# Global Crossing (2002)

This telecommunications company was accused of swapping network capacity with other carriers to artificially boost revenue. Global Crossing would sell capacity on its network to another carrier while simultaneously buying an equal amount of capacity from that carrier, with no money changing hands. This practice inflated reported revenues without generating actual cash flow.

# Qwest Communications (2002-2004)

The telecom giant was found to have engaged in round-trip transactions involving the swapping of fiber-optic capacity with other companies. These deals were structured to appear as legitimate sales and purchases, but in reality, they were designed to inflate revenues artificially.

# Computer Associates (2004)

The software company was involved in a $2.2 billion accounting fraud that included round-tripping. They used a practice called the ""35-day month,"" where they kept their books open for an extra few days to record additional revenue from the next quarter, creating a perpetual cycle of inflated earnings.

# Nortel Networks (2007)

The Canadian telecommunications equipment manufacturer was found to have engaged in various accounting irregularities, including round-tripping. They manipulated revenue recognition by recording sales to distributors as final sales, even when the products were likely to be returned.

# Wirecard (2020)

While not exclusively a tech company, Wirecard was a major player in digital payment processing. The company was found to have engaged in massive fraud, including round-tripping transactions. They created fake customer accounts and used a network of partner companies to simulate legitimate business activities, inflating their reported revenues and cash balances.

These examples demonstrate that round-tripping has been a persistent issue in the tech sector, often used to artificially inflate revenues, manipulate stock prices, and deceive investors. The complex nature of technology businesses and their often intangible assets can make it easier to engage in such deceptive practices. However, increased regulatory scrutiny and improved auditing practices have made it more challenging for companies to engage in round-tripping without detection. 

# AI Labs Round Tripping

 

The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion.

# Artificial Inflation of Revenue

When tech giants invest in AI startups or provide them with datacenter credits, they essentially create a loop where their initial financial outlay returns to them as revenue. This cycle artificially inflates their cloud and AI service usage metrics, presenting an illusion of robust growth. For example, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) have invested billions in AI firms like Anthropic, which then become major consumers of AWS's cloud services. This arrangement leads to an inflated perception of demand for these services, despite the fact that the growth is internally generated rather than stemming from new market participants.

# Lack of Economic Substance

These transactions often lack real economic substance because the AI labs are primarily spending money provided by the tech companies themselves. This means that instead of attracting new, independent customers or generating fresh revenue streams, the tech companies are simply cycling their own funds back into their revenue reports. Such practices can mislead stakeholders into believing that there is a substantial increase in market demand when, in reality, the growth is not driven by external factors.

# Misleading Market Perception

# Inflated Growth Figures

By reporting increased usage of their cloud and AI services due to these internal transactions, tech companies create a misleading picture of sector growth. This self-generated growth does not reflect broader market demand but rather a strategic manipulation to enhance financial statements. As highlighted by industry analysts, this practice can give an impression of thriving business activity that may not exist.

# Skewed Competition Metrics

This practice also distorts the competitive landscape by making it appear that certain companies are outperforming others in attracting AI business. In reality, these companies are subsidizing usage through investments and credits, which can skew competition metrics and obscure true market dynamics.

# Financial Interdependence

The symbiotic relationship created between tech giants and AI labs through these arrangements can lead to reduced innovation. AI labs may become overly reliant on specific cloud providers for resources, limiting their ability to explore diverse technological solutions. Additionally, this interdependence can result in conflicts of interest in the development and deployment of AI technologies, as the success of the startups becomes closely tied to the continued support from their benefactor companies.

# Regulatory and Accounting Concerns

# Revenue Recognition Issues

Questions arise regarding how these transactions should be accounted for. If a company invests in an AI startup and subsequently recognizes revenue from that startup's usage of its services, it creates a complex accounting situation that may not accurately reflect the company's true financial position. This ambiguity opens up potential for manipulation, as companies could use these arrangements to meet growth targets or analyst expectations.

# Potential for Manipulation

The practice opens the door for potential manipulation of financial statements. Companies might engage in these arrangements to artificially boost reported revenues, thereby meeting or exceeding market expectations without actual underlying business growth.

# Market Distortion

This practice can lead to a distorted view of the AI and cloud computing markets. By overestimating market size and growth rates based on inflated projections from round-tripping deals, resources may be misallocated. This could potentially create an AI bubble driven by circular investments rather than genuine demand. 

# Conclusion

In conclusion, while providing resources to AI labs can drive innovation, the current practice of offering datacenter credits and reporting resulting usage as growth shares similarities with financial round-tripping. It raises significant concerns about transparency, authenticity in corporate reporting, and potential distortions in market perceptions within the AI and cloud computing sectors.

# TLDR;

The practice of tech giants providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting the resulting usage as growth is essentially a modern form of financial round-tripping. This deceptive cycle artificially inflates revenue and usage metrics, creating a false perception of market demand. It distorts the competitive landscape, potentially stifles innovation, and raises serious regulatory concerns. Most alarmingly, it could be fueling an AI bubble based on circular investments rather than genuine market growth. Investors and regulators should be wary of this practice, as it may be masking the true state of the AI and cloud computing markets, potentially leading to misallocation of resources and inflated valuations in the tech sector."

> The parcel giant was hurt by a pullback on priority services as customers traded down to cheaper shipping options in what Chief Executive Officer Raj Subramaniam called “a challenging quarter.” A broad effort to slash costs gained traction but only partially blunted those headwinds, the Memphis-based company said late Thursday.

> FedEx’s shares slid 14% after the markets opened Friday in New York, the biggest intraday decline since September 2022. Rival United Parcel Service Inc. fell 3.4%.

> The results spooked investors looking for signals about where the economy is headed after the Federal Reserve this week cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2020.

# What’s Happening?

1. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: The ILA plays a vital role in moving goods in and out of ports. A prolonged strike could lead to significant delays in shipments, affecting everything from retail to manufacturing.
2. **Rising Prices**: With supply chains strained, we could see increased prices on everyday goods. Retailers may pass on shipping costs to consumers, which could contribute to inflation.
3. **Impact on Jobs**: While the strike focuses on union members, it could also affect ancillary businesses—like transportation and warehousing—leading to job losses or reduced hours for many.
4. **Long-Term Industry Changes**: Depending on the strike's duration, companies might seek alternative shipping methods or routes, which could reshape industry standards and lead to lasting changes in how goods are transported.
5. **Investor Confidence**: Ongoing labor disputes can create uncertainty in the market. Investors might pull back, leading to volatility that could affect stock prices and economic growth."

26,2024-09-20,20,"Three Stock sectors that are the direct beneficiaries of the interest rate cut. * Changes in the interest rate usually impact the stock market immediately and its effect on the economy may take about a year.
* A drop in interest rate tends to lift the stock market but is not equal across the board.
* The Fed believes GDP growth remains solid with the labor market appearing healthy and inflation trending back to 2%.
* The Summary of economic projections (SEP) points to another 50 basis points of cuts in 2024, and another 100 basis points in 2025.
* FOMC believes interest rates will stabilize in 2026.

There are going to be much more interest rate cuts at least to the end of 2025 and here are the three sectors that would benefit the most from the multiple rate cuts:

1. **Financial sector** --> Banks' lending and refinancing activities ramp up with the falling interest rates.  Banks, insurance companies, and mortgage lenders also benefit from borrowing more money at lower rates.  The lending default rate significantly drops with cheaper refinancing and an improving economy.
2. **Technology sector** --> Technology stock valuations are heavily dependent on their future earnings which directly benefit from decreasing interest rates.  A lower borrowing cost is critical to the growth of tech companies.
3. **Real Estate sector** --> Mortgages become more affordable which would lead to a rise in demand for properties, and increase profitability of real estate investments."
360,2024-09-20,91,"A Three Mile Island nuclear reactor could restart under a new deal with Microsoft https://www.inquirer.com/business/energy/three-mile-island-microsoft-constellation-proposal-20240920.html

Five years after a nuclear reactor at the Three Mile Island plant in central Pennsylvania closed amid financial troubles, its owner wants to bring it back online.

Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Corp. said Friday that it has signed a 20-year agreement with Microsoft under which the technology company will purchase power from Three Mile Island Unit 1. That reactor is located at an independent facility from Unit 2, which closed in 1979 after experiencing a partial meltdown

Constellation said it would spend $1.6 billion to restart Unit 1 — and won’t seek any public subsidies — which the company said “operated at industry-leading levels of safety and reliability for decades.” Federal regulators would need to approve a restart, though it already has support from Gov. Josh Shapiro. The company said it expects the reactor to come online by 2028.

“I think policymakers have recognized that a strategy that is dependent just on wind, solar, batteries isn’t going to fully get us there and meet the needs of the system from a reliability standpoint,” Joe Dominguez, Constellation’s president and CEO, said in an interview.

For Microsoft, buying energy from the renewed plant, dubbed the Crane Clean Energy Center, will “help match the power its data centers in PJM use with carbon-free energy,” according to a news release. Valley Forge-based PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization, operates the electric grid in 13 states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Exelon Generation pulled the plug on 837-megawatt Unit 1 in 2019 after state lawmakers declined to support legislation that would have directed hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies from Pennsylvania electric customers to the state’s nuclear industry. Exelon at the time said it couldn’t compete in markets dominated by low-cost natural gas. Constellation’s predecessor company split from Exelon in 2022.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

15,2024-09-20,9,"Would there be anything wrong with buying short ETFs and attaching tight trailing stop losses to them? So I have been keeping track of the VIX and how it moves. When it goes well below the 50 day moving average I begin to invest in SQQQ and SDOW. I buy them usually on an afternoon then the next morning attach sell trailing stop loss orders of 0.4%, 0.8% and then 1.2%. These are not just short ETFs but they are leveraged. They move quick at times and when we have red days they make me a lot of money. Most of the movement with these happens during non-trading hours. 

I about 30% of the time guess wrong and those trailing stop sell orders come in handy then. I'm not aware of any brokerages that allow these short ETFs to be traded during non-trading hours (if anyone knows of any let me know bc that would be a game changer). 

Is there otherwise anything wrong with this? Why doesn't everyone all the time do exactly this? This has made me a lot of money and the more I think of it maybe the smart thing to do is buy up the long (leveraged) ETFs like TQQQ and UDOW and attach the 0.4% etc sell trailing stop loss orders. When we have a really positive day like today (Sept. 19, 2024) sure your SQQQ and SDOW will sell off immediately but you will offset those losses and still make bank on the TQQQ and UDOW. "

Mercedes-Benz Group AG adjusts full-year guidance for the year 2024 based on current market outlook

Stuttgart, Germany - As a result of recent developments, Mercedes-Benz Group AG today adjusted its earnings outlook for the year 2024 for Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Group.

This was triggered by a further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, mainly in China. GDP growth in China lost further momentum amid weaker consumption as well as the continued downturn in the real estate sector. This affected the overall sales volume in China including sales in the Top-End segment. Overall, the sales mix in the second half of 2024 is expected to remain unchanged versus the first half, and therefore weaker than originally expected.

Additionally, the second half of 2024 is expected to be impacted by various valuation adjustments. Furthermore, the dynamic pricing environment is expected to continue.

Therefore, Mercedes-Benz Group has updated its full-year outlook:

Mercedes-Benz Cars now expects the adjusted Return on Sales to be between 7.5% and 8.5% (previously: 10% to 11%). This implies an expected adjusted Return on Sales of around 6% for the second half of the year. The valuation adjustments are expected to have an impact of around 1 percentage point in the second half of this year.
Mercedes-Benz Vans’ expected adjusted Return on Sales (14% to 15%) and Mercedes-Benz Mobility’s expected adjusted Return on Equity (8.5% to 9.5%) remain unchanged.
Mercedes-Benz Group’s EBIT is now expected to be significantly below the prior year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).
Free cash flow of the industrial business for the Mercedes-Benz Group is now expected to be significantly below the prior-year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).

# Historical Context

In 2021, PureCycle faced significant challenges:

* Short-seller reports from highly credible sources such as Hindenburg Research questioned the company's technology and financial projections.
* Concerns were raised about the scalability of their recycling process.
* The company faced regulatory scrutiny and investor lawsuits.

These issues led to volatility in PureCycle's stock price and raised doubts about the company's future.

# Recent Developments

Despite past challenges, PureCycle's latest updates indicate advancements:

1. **Operational Progress**: The Ironton, Ohio facility reportedly achieved:
   * Feed rates exceeding 10,000 pounds per hour
   * Processing over 200,000 pounds of feedstock in a single day
   * Over 1 million pounds processed in a seven-day span
2. **Technological Improvements**: Successfully installed and commissioned modifications to the co-product removal system.
3. **Transition to Commercial Operations**:
   * Compounded approximately 1,500,000 pounds to date
   * Plans for increased production and sales in Q4 2024
4. **Financial Backing**: Secured $90 million in new financing, suggesting ongoing interest in protecting the equity of current shareholders leading the largest shareholder to double down with 8million more shares last week.

# Addressing Past Concerns

While these developments don't definitively resolve all previous criticisms, they potentially address some key points:

1. **Scalability**: The reported production volumes suggest progress in scaling up operations.
2. **Technology Viability**: Continuous operation and product output indicate the core technology is functional.
3. **Market Interest**: Planned sales and investor backing point to potential market demand.

# Looking Ahead

PureCycle's journey illustrates the challenges of bringing new recycling technologies to market.

The **game-changing polypropylene recycling** technology that PureCycle uses consists of seven main process stages that help close the loop on plastic waste while making recycled plastics more accessible at scale.

PureCycle Technologies claims to have developed a novel approach to recycling polypropylene (PP), one of the most widely used plastics. Here's an overview of how their technology differs from traditional recycling methods:

# Traditional PP Recycling Challenges

1. **Color and Odor**: Conventional recycling often results in grayish, odorous plastics.
2. **Contamination**: Additives and impurities are difficult to remove completely.
3. **Quality**: Recycled PP typically has inferior properties compared to virgin plastic.
4. **Limited Applications**: Due to quality issues, recycled PP has limited use cases.

# PureCycle's Innovative Approach

PureCycle's technology aims to address these challenges through a proprietary purification process:

1. **Solvent-based Purification**:
   * Uses a non-toxic solvent to dissolve and purify polypropylene.
   * Claimed to remove colors, odors, and contaminants more effectively than mechanical recycling.
2. **Preservation of Polymer Structure**:
   * The process reportedly maintains the molecular structure of PP.
   * This could result in recycled plastic with properties similar to virgin material.
3. **Broader Feedstock Acceptance**:
   * Can potentially process a wider range of PP waste, including low-quality or contaminated sources.
4. **Ultra-Pure Output**:
   * The end product is said to be colorless, odorless, and free from most contaminants.
   * This could allow for use in food-grade and medical applications.
5. **Energy Efficiency**:
   * The process is claimed to be more energy-efficient than producing virgin PP.

# Key Differentiators

1. **Quality of Output**: PureCycle claims its recycled PP is virtually indistinguishable from virgin plastic.
2. **Scalability**: The technology is designed for large-scale, continuous operation.
3. **Circular Economy Potential**: By producing high-quality recycled PP, it could enable true closed-loop recycling for this material.

# Potential Impact

If successful at scale, PureCycle's technology could:

* Increase the value and demand for recycled PP
* Reduce dependency on virgin plastic production
* Enable new applications for recycled plastics in sensitive industries

# Challenges and Considerations

* The technology is still scaling up, and long-term performance is yet to be fully demonstrated.
* Economic viability at large scale needs to be proven.

Walmart Inc. customers will soon have the option to pay directly from their bank accounts with instant transfers for online purchases. The enhanced feature is a flash point in the escalating tensions between merchants and the card networks setting the fees for payment processing.

The world’s largest retailer has offered pay-by-bank through Walmart Pay since earlier this year. Until now, the transactions were akin to digital checks and took roughly three days to finalize when being processed through The Automated Clearing House, the same network often used for bill payments or paycheck deposits. Soon, customers opting for pay-by-bank transactions will see the purchase reflected in their bank account balance instantly – and Walmart will receive the funds immediately.

The consumer advantage of instant pay-by-bank over debit cards is avoiding stacked pending transactions. For customers carrying low balances, pending transactions can open them up to the risk of overdraft or non-sufficient funds fees from their bank, according to Jamie Henry, vice president of emerging payments at Walmart.

In the US, most consumers carry credit or debit cards which offer convenience, fraud protections and, in the case of credit products, rewards programs. However, frustration has mounted among merchants over fees they pay for card processing to banks and networks like Visa and Mastercard.

[Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/germany-s-slump-in-ev-sales-drags-on-europe-s-auto-market) 

> EV deliveries in the region’s biggest car market [(Germany)] fell 69% during August, fueling a 36% drop across the region, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said Thursday. [...] With the battery-car market share shrinking to 14% in August — down from just over 15% last year 

[Figure of the above statistics](https://i.imgur.com/5eFiBdk.png). Germany cutting subsidies was a big blow to the industry. [New car registrations also dropping](https://i.imgur.com/w9SKOjh.png).

## The Threat of Chinese Exports to US/Europe

Meanwhile, China is the new auto giant. [This graph of exports by country is from early 2024](https://i.imgur.com/nPAd2wh.jpeg)--China is the Japan of the 1980s. The threat of Chinese competition is so high that EU is considering 50% tariffs (currently 15% on Chinese EVs), while the US is at 100%. In past years, I've always heard that Chinese cars are junk. Junk cars wouldn't need to need to have their price doubled to keep consumers from buying them. In other countries, Chinese brands are taking over the nascent EV market: ""Chinese automakers accounted for 88% of the EV market in Brazil and 70% in Thailand in the first quarter of this year.""

In Europe, despite tariffs: ""Chinese carmakers' share of passenger car sales in Europe rose to 17% in the first seven months of 2024 from 12% a year earlier, according to data from automotive consultancy Inovev, and Chinese car exports have reached record highs this year."" [(Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-auto-suppliers-ev-makers-flood-major-trade-fair-germany-2024-09-10/).

> Foreign brands’ market share of Chinese auto sales is tracking at a record low of 37 per cent in the first seven months of 2024, down from 64 per cent in 2020, according to data from Automobility, a Shanghai consultancy. So far this year, US brands are down more than 23 per cent while Japanese, Korean and German carmakers have also suffered double-digit declines, the data showed. By contrast, sales of Chinese brands are up nearly 22 per cent with Chinese companies overwhelmingly dominating sales of the EV market.

## Technological Edge in EVs for China?

[Nearly 40% of Chinese auto sales are of EVs](https://i.imgur.com/cqX6jts.png) versus 10% for the US and 21% for Europe. Aren't the US/EU supposed to be championing the green revolution in autos? BYD had a 5% share of Chinese cars in 2022--today it's 20%.  That's a big threat to Tesla for instance, who gets 20% of its revenue from China.

## Possible Bull Case

So  is there a bull case for VW? Here is a [Sum of the Parts](https://x.com/StanphylCap/status/1832096596319727717) bull case for Volkswagen. VW owns stakes in Porche, Traton in addition to owning Audi, VW cars, Skoda, Seat, Cupra Lamborghini, Bentley and Ducati. I don't fully understand how the debt impacts the analysis here, though. OP claims the debt is held by a captive finance arm and fully secured by leased cars + non-recourse (only collateral can be pursued, nothing more).

## Closing Thoughts

How are European automakers going to handle the competitive threat of a new Chinese auto juggernaut along with massive fiscal support in the US (from the IRA)? Their energy prices face much higher spikes [than in the US and China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2023/09/21/energy-europes-big-disadvantage/). Labor unions are much more powerful in Europe, making cost cuts difficult. Autos are already a very difficult sector to invest in, but I suspect European cars brands may be uninvestible and they are rightfully cheap on a P/E basis (if earnings are even positive).

*One argument for cutting rates by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, instead of 50 basis points goes like this: The Federal Reserve only makes larger cuts when something is going wrong in the economy or financial system.*  
  
*And that’s partly true, but it also misses an important point.*  
  
*Since the Fed began to publicize interest-rate changes in 1994, the central bank has moved from a neutral stance to a cutting stance six times.*  
  
*The Fed initiated shallow cutting cycles in 1995, 1998, and 2019, each time leading off with a cut of 25 basis points.*  
  
*The Fed began what would be deeper cutting cycles three times, in early 2001, 2007, and when the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread in March 2020, each time leading with a cut of 50 basis points.*  
  
*This has led many analysts to conclude that larger cuts of 50 basis points are “reserved” for more severe situations, and there is some truth to this pattern.*  
  
*Stock markets were sliding as the tech bubble began to deflate with the Fed cut rates in January 2001 by 50 basis points. The bursting of a subprime mortgage-credit bubble in August 2007 preceded the Fed’s cut of the same magnitude in September 2007.*  
  
*At the same time, Fed officials at both of those meetings still thought their more aggressive action might preempt a downturn, according to the transcripts of those meetings. In other words, just because 50-basis-point cuts look, in retrospect, like actions reserved for the start of a recession, officials didn’t think that way in real time.*"

I'm an amateur in the knowledge of stocks. im trying to learns and everyone starts somewhere.. i want to invest a lot of money into shares of a company. they do not give dividends but if they were to ever grow as a company could they give dividends per share later.

446,2024-09-19,214,"Why I think we’re in for a massive rally into year end So take this with a grain of salt as I’m just a random guy on the internet. But I’ll lay out the following reasons why I believe we’re going to have a massive rally.

1. Earnings are strong and are expected to be strong going forward. Of course, this could change but regardless it’s the consensus at the moment.

2. There is a surprising amount of bearishness in the market despite the fact that we’re at ATHs. You’re hearing people talk about seasonal weakness in Sept/Oct everywhere, AAII investor sentiment saw bearishness at 31% in the last survey which is exactly the historical average. This is quite strange given the market is at ATHs. I believe that many people are offsides and will chase.

3. The Fed’s decision to cut 50bps today. Lower interest rates help rate sensitive segments of the economy, help rate sensitive companies (small caps, REITs, private equity, etc.), and lower the hurdle rate for stocks. When the risk free rate is lower, investors don’t need as much expected return from stocks to justify buying them.

4. That ties into my next point, the “$6T of cash on the sidelines”. As rates come down, some of that money will find its way into stocks. I’m already seeing a lot of chatter about people wondering if it’s time to take money out of their HYSA and buy stocks. 

5. It’s an election year, and post-election season tends to be extremely strong for stocks historically. This of course could be different since it’s such a polarizing election.

6. Despite what many believe, valuations are not that high. The forward P/E for the S&P 500 right now is 22.5x, which is actually the lowest it’s been since Q3 2022. 

7. The AI hype seems to be pretty dead right now. If we get anything major on that front in the next 3 months, that could add fuel to the fire. 

Of course, this is all conjecture. And there’s still a lot of uncertainty around the economy. But I think the conditions are ripe for a massive upside move in stocks."
39,2024-09-18,7,"YouTube announces AI features from Google DeepMind for Shorts creators  YouTube on Wednesday announced artificial-intelligence features for creators on its Shorts platform that tap into Google’s DeepMind video-generation model.

The features, known as Veo, will allow creators to add AI-generated backgrounds to their videos as well as use written prompts to generate standalone, six-second video clips. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said he hopes Veo will enable creators to produce more Shorts videos with the help of AI.

“Everything that we showed with AI was meant to really enhance the work that you do, make it faster, more efficient, to bring your creative ideas to life faster,” said Mohan, speaking at the Made on YouTube event in New York.

The Veo AI backgrounds are an upgrade over a similar AI-generation feature announced by YouTube in 2023 called Dream Screen. The company said its Veo AI background feature will roll out later this year while the six-second AI clips will become available in 2025.

Other announcements at the event included new features in the YouTube Studio app that will allow creators to use AI to generate titles, thumbnails and video ideas. Those features will roll out in late 2024, YouTube said.

Creators have been exploring various ways to leverage generative AI technology. Creators have used the new technology to insert clips in their videos or produce entirely AI-generated videos.

However, some creators expressed concerns that their videos on YouTube are used to train the AI models that built Veo.

“I don’t know how I feel about all this AI stuff,” said Thomas Simons, a comedian with more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube. “It doesn’t fill me with confidence and love.”

There has been criticism that other services like Facebook have become overrun by spammy, AI-generated content. There are also concerns that AI-generated content could violate intellectual property protections.

YouTube’s AI-generated content will be watermarked and will have a label indicating it was created by AI, the company said.

Generative AI places a new perspective on the creator economy, giving creators free access to tools utilized by large language models.

We “really sit at the nexus of that technology and creativity,” Mohan said. “Putting those two things together gives us this unique lens that everything we build is really about enhancing that human creativity.”

*Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.*  
  
*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.*  
  
*In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*  
  
*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*  
  
*Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action was Michelle W. Bowman, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at this meeting.*"
0,2024-09-18,101,"A 50bps Fed Rate Cut Could Spark a 300-Point Market Rally Today With the Federal Reserve’s decision looming, there’s a lot of buzz about what a potential rate cut could mean for the market today. If the Fed delivers a 50 basis point cut, it could trigger a surge of optimism and a major rally in the stock market.  
  
Here's why I believe we could see a 300-point jump today:  
  
Boosting Investor Confidence: A deeper rate cut would signal that the Fed is committed to propping up the economy amid ongoing uncertainties. This would inject a lot of confidence into both institutional and retail investors, who are eager for signs that the Fed is taking bold action.

  
Cheaper Borrowing Costs: Lower rates make borrowing cheaper for companies, encouraging business investments and spending. Investors often see this as a precursor to growth, further pushing stocks higher.  
Easing Recession Fears: There’s been growing concern about a potential economic slowdown, and a significant cut would help ease those fears, signaling that the Fed is proactive. This could drive capital back into the market, particularly in sectors that have been lagging due to recession worries.

  
Market Sentiment: Historically, aggressive rate cuts have resulted in strong short-term market reactions. With a 50 basis point cut, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all post substantial gains by the end of the day.

  
It’s important to remember that nothing is guaranteed, but if the Fed comes through with this aggressive move, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the market finish 300 points higher, if not more. What do you think? Could this spark the rally we’ve been waiting for, or is the market too unpredictable to call?  
  
Let’s see what happens!"
633,2024-09-18,133,"Boeing starts furloughing 'large number' of employees as strike continues Boeing will furlough a “large number” of U.S. executives, managers and other staff, citing the ongoing machinist strike as the company races to preserve cash, CEO Kelly Ortberg told employees on Wednesday.

The furloughs will affect tens of thousands of Boeing employees, a company spokesperson said.

The plan came less than a week after Boeing’s more than 30,000 machinists in the Seattle area and Oregon voted down a new labor contract and 96% voted to strike, walking off the job just after midnight on Friday.

Ortberg said affected employees would take one week of furlough every four weeks for the strike’s duration and he and his team would take “commensurate” pay cuts for the duration of the strike.

“While this is a tough decision that impacts everybody, it is in an effort to preserve our long-term future and help us navigate through this very difficult time. We will continue to transparently communicate as this dynamic situation evolves and do all we can to limit this hardship,” Ortberg said in his message.

Boeing’s CFO Brian West earlier this week said the company would freeze hiring and raises to cut costs, and would let “non-essential contractors” go temporarily.

With a p-value of 0.2169 its not a statistically significant strategy when using the standard significance level of 5%. The sharpe-ratio 0.94 also tells us that it has a higher risk/reward ratio compared to the s&p500 with a sharpe of 1.06. However i still find it to be an interesting dicovery, and i believe other people will as well.

Any thoughts?

230,2024-09-18,29,"Google wins court challenge to the EU's $1.7 billion antitrust fine over ad product  The European Union’s second-highest court on Wednesday said a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) fine imposed on Google by regulators should be annulled, siding with the U.S. tech giant after it challenged the ruling.

The case stems from 2019 when the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said Alphabet owned Google had abused its market dominance in relation to a product called AdSense for Search. This product allowed website owners to deliver ads into the search results on their own pages.

Google acts as an intermediary allowing advertisers to serve ads via search on third-party websites.

But the commission alleged that Google abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites, which ultimately prevented rivals from placing their search ads on these websites.

The commission fined Google 1.49 billion euros at the time. Google appealed, sending the case to the EU’s General Court.

The General Court said Wednesday that it “upholds the majority of the findings” but “annuls the decision by which the Commission imposed a fine of” nearly 1.5 billion euros.

The court added that the commission “failed to take into consideration all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contract clauses” that it had deemed abusive.

A Google spokesperson told CNBC that it would review the full decision closely.

“This case is about a very narrow subset of text-only search ads placed on a limited number of publishers’ websites. We made changes to our contracts in 2016 to remove the relevant provisions, even before the Commission’s decision. We are pleased that the court has recognized errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,” the spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for the commission said it takes note of the judgement and will reflect on the possible next steps.

The commission could appeal this decision which would send it up to European Court of Justice, the EU’s top court.

There has been a slew of court cases involving the EU and U.S. tech companies reaching their conclusions recently.

This month, the ECJ upheld a 2.4 billion euro fine imposed on Google for abusing its dominant position by favoring its own shopping comparison service. And the same court ruled that Apple must pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, ending a decade-long case.

0,2024-09-18,15,"Wash sale rule Explanation- Am I understanding this right? I made a lot of trades in 2024, I was up 50k at one point and then gave back almost all the profit and I am only up around 4k currently for 2024. I am assuming I only have to pay capital gains taxes on 4k profit for the year, not 50k or some figure more than my overall gains of 4k because of wash sale rule. I did lot of day trading and buying same stock within 30 days of selling and I wanted to understand the implications of wash sale rule. I currently have sold all my positions and do not hold any stock/options and I am up 4k on the year.

Example 1: I bought NVDA calls on August 14, sold on August 15 for gains of 5k. Then I bought NVDA calls on August 20 and sold on August 25 for loss of 3k. I did this several times with NVDA stock and options and have profit of 20k from NVDA and loss of 19k with overall net gain of around 1k on NVDA. I am trying to understand wash sale rule and my understanding is I only have to pay capital gains taxes for 1k on NVDA. My cost basis on my second purchase gets adjusted from profit on first purchase and my cost basis for third purchase gets adjusted based on profit/loss from second sell and so on for future purchase. Is this correct statement? Also, I currently do not hold any NVDA stocks or options, I sold them all.

Example 2: I did same thing with AMZN stock too. I bought calls, sold for some loss, bought more calls within 30 days and sold for some profit and rinse and repeat. I did this multiple times throughout the year.

I traded mostly tech stocks and at one point was in profit in excess of 50k. However I did not sell at the top and the stocks came crashing down and I lost all my profit. At one point I lost all profit and was 20k down on my cost basis too. I was able to recover my loss and I am up 4k in the year. I am now thinking about my Uncle sam and how much does he want for 2024. With no current positions in any stock/options currently, my thinking is just taxes on 4k profit. Let me know if I am wrong or if there is something that I am overlooking and if I need to put more money away for my taxes."
376,2024-09-18,417,"Received $85,000 recently. Should we put it in an ETF such as S&P500 right now or wait? Hi Everyone 
I received around $85,000 recently as a back payment for a long term consultancy assignment I was working. Instead of spending it, I was thinking of saving it on the side for the future. Now the question - should I put the amount in an ETF right now such as S&P 500. I’m skeptical of the stock market these days considering it’s already overvalued and the risk of an impending recession but then I also get a FOMO. The second option I’ve been thinking about is putting the entire money in either bonds or t-bills for a safe return without risk. 

Your advice, albeit I understand non financial, would be greatly appreciated. "

# [Stock futures rise slightly as traders debate how big the Fed’s anticipated rate cut will be: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Wednesday as Wall Street anticipated the first Federal Reserve interest rate cut in four years. Gains were muted as uncertainty lingered over how big the easing will be from the central bank.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 36 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.2% each.
*****
> The Fed is expected to deliver its latest policy decision at 2 p.m. ET. The central bank is expected to lower rates by at least a quarter percentage point, but traders are divided over how big the reduction will be. CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows traders pricing in a 65% chance of a half-point cut and 35% odds of a quarter-point move.
*****
> It’s unusual to have this much uncertainty into a Fed decision as the central bank typically tries to telegraph its next move to the markets. Traders had believed for most of the last month that the Fed would lower by a quarter point, but the idea of a super-sized cut began to gain traction in the past week.
*****
> “You’d have to go back over 15 years to find such an uncertain situation this close to the decision. A lot of money will be made and lost today,” Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank head of global economics and thematic research, wrote in a Wednesday note.
*****
> The ushering in of a cutting cycle is expected to shore up a stalling economy and further boost an already strong market, with the S&P 500 at a record following an 18% gain this year. The benchmark has averaged gains of about 16% in the 12 months following the first cut, according to data from Canaccord Genuity.
*****
> Despite these market expectations, some investors remain cautious about cutting rates too much, too soon. Peter Cecchini, Axonic Capital’s director of research, called a 50 basis point cut “unusual” as the first move in a cutting cycle from the Fed given the current state of the housing market.
*****
> “This is not really the environment where I think the Fed needs to do a 50 basis point cut as a preemptive measure, when historically it’s never done so,” he told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a mixed session that saw the S&P 500 edge up 0.03% after notching another all-time high during intraday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 16 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%.

425,2024-09-17,83,"BlackRock and Microsoft plan $30bn fund to invest in AI infrastructure   
[https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb](https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb)

BlackRock is preparing to launch a more than $30bn artificial intelligence investment fund with technology giant Microsoft to build data centres and energy projects to meet growing demands stemming from AI.  

The financial partnership, which BlackRock is launching with its new infrastructure investment unit, Global Infrastructure Partners, would be one of the biggest investment vehicles ever raised on Wall Street. Microsoft and MGX, the Abu Dhabi-backed investment company, are general partners in the fund. Nvidia, the fast-growing chipmaker, will advise on factory design and integration. 

The investment vehicle is aimed at addressing the staggering power and digital infrastructure demands of building AI products that are expected to face severe capacity bottlenecks in coming years. The computing power of AI requires far more energy than previous technological innovations and has strained existing energy infrastructure. 

Dubbed the Global AI Investment Partnership, the effort seeks to raise up to $30bn in equity investments and leverage that to support up to an additional $70bn in debt financing. 

The fund would mark GIP’s first big fund since the private infrastructure investment group agreed to be acquired by BlackRock for $12.5bn earlier this year. That deal is due to close in October.

BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, has highlighted the energy sector as one of its top opportunities for growth. “Mobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centres and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity,” Larry Fink, BlackRock chief executive, said in a statement. Larry Fink: ‘Mobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity’ © Bloomberg 

The soon-to-be launched fund is the latest vehicle created by a large asset manager to meet the ever-growing demand for energy to power generative AI and cloud computing. Earlier this year Microsoft agreed to back $10bn in renewable electricity projects built by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management. Microsoft has made a commitment to ensure 100 per cent of its energy consumption is matched by zero carbon energy purchases by 2030.  

“The country and the world are going to need more capital investment to accelerate the development of the AI infrastructure needed. This kind of effort is an important step,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president. 

MGX was created earlier this year with the backing of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to advance the country’s progress in AI. It has been in talks to invest in Open AI’s next funding round. 

In 2017, Blackstone announced plans for a $40bn infrastructure vehicle with backing from Saudi Arabia, and Brookfield last year raised $28bn for what was described as the largest ever infrastructure fund. 

The International Energy Agency estimates that global electricity consumption by data centres could surpass 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026, more than twice the amount used in 2022.  Recommended LexBig Tech Data centres have turned Big Tech into big spenders Premium content 

“Accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder, said in a statement. 

In the US, which hosts one-third of the world’s data centres, electricity demand is rising rapidly for the first time in two decades, driven partly by these energy-intensive facilities. A report from Grid Strategies indicates that five-year projections for electricity demand growth in the US have nearly doubled over the past year, increasing from 2.6 per cent to 4.7 per cent. 

“There is a clear need to mobilise significant amounts of private capital to fund investments in essential infrastructure,” Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP’s chief executive, said in a statement."

4,2024-09-17,9,"Good books on market cycles? I'm curious what books people here have enjoyed reading about the cyclical nature of the stock market. It's becoming somewhat noticeable to me that the stock market seems to have a multi-year cyclical nature in confluence with global liquidity cycles, interest rate cycles, and other potential cycles that I think might relate but don't know enough to say they do (real estate, elections, etc). I'm not educated enough to necessarily claim that there ARE indeed cycles for these things .. but it seems like there might be.

Has anyone read a helpful book or books that work toward connecting all these dots and seeing the market movements from a higher, cyclical perspective?"

4,2024-09-17,9,"(DD) Limoneira - LMNR - Citrus fruits and Real Estate. Two things that will continue to go up in price. Alright, listen up—**Limoneira Co. (LMNR)** is more than just another agribusiness. This company is strategically positioned in multiple growth sectors with a solid balance of core revenue and serious upside potential. Let’s get into the technicals:

# Company Snapshot

* **Ticker**: LMNR
* **Sector**: Agribusiness, Real Estate Development, Renewable Energy
* **Core Focus**: Limoneira is one of the largest producers of lemons in the U.S. and globally. On top of that, they’ve diversified into real estate development and solar energy, creating multiple revenue streams.
* **Market Cap**: \~$450-500 million (a small-cap with room to run)
* **Founded**: 1893 (These guys aren’t new to the game, and their longevity speaks to strong fundamentals)

# Strategic Advantages

# A. Dominant Player in Citrus Production

* **Lemons & Avocados**: Limoneira owns about over 12,000 acres of farmland across California, Arizona, and Chile. That’s huge. They’re a major supplier of lemons, with a foothold in high-margin markets. They're essentially what replaced the Florida citrus industry. The global demand for citrus—especially lemons—is growing due to health trends, and Limoneira is well-positioned to capitalize.
* **Vertical Integration**: The company controls its supply chain—farming, packing, and marketing—which maximizes margins and improves operational efficiency. Limoneira isn’t just a grower; they manage their product from farm to table, cutting down on costs and giving them more control over pricing.
* **HLB Disease Wiping out Competition**: Buckle up, this point is going to be a bit controversial. HLB (Huanglongbing) is a disease that was responsible for the collapse of the Florida citrus industry and is actively killing citrus farms worldwide. Limoneira remains unaffected by HLB to this day, and appears to be at the forefront of HLB prevention. They're ahead of the curve and has had the luxury of time to develop various methods to secure HLB prevention. This means that citrus supply is decreasing worldwide while Limoneira is one of the very few companies that can meet growing demands. Citrus products get pricier, Limoneira makes more profit.

# B. Real Estate as a Long-Term Growth Catalyst

* **Harvest at Limoneira**: This is where the big money’s going to come from. They’re developing a 1,500-home community on prime California real estate. Over time, this project is expected to generate significant cash flow and push earnings higher. If you like steady long-term gains, real estate adds a substantial value to their portfolio.
* **Land Appreciation**: Limoneira’s holding tons of land across high-demand regions. As real estate prices keep climbing in California and Arizona, this land is an undervalued asset sitting on their balance sheet. That’s baked-in value that hasn’t fully been realized yet by the market.

C. **Sustainability and Renewable Energy**

* **Solar Energy Investments**: Limoneira has made strategic investments in solar power, reducing their energy costs and boosting their environmental profile. In an age where ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) matters more than ever, Limoneira’s ahead of the curve.
* **Water Conservation**: Given California’s ongoing water challenges, Limoneira’s focus on water efficiency adds a key operational edge. Their ability to sustain production through efficient water use is crucial in maintaining stable margins and addressing regulatory concerns.

# Financial Performance

# A. Revenue Growth and Stability

* **Consistent Cash Flow**: Despite the cyclical nature of agriculture, Limoneira has maintained steady revenue. Their diversified operations—agriculture, real estate, renewable energy—create a solid foundation for consistent cash flow. Citrus production alone has shown strong demand resilience, with premium pricing power in high-end markets.

# B. Real Estate Boost to Earnings

* **Massive Upside from Harvest Project**: Harvest at Limoneira is expected to deliver serious returns. While the agricultural side of the business keeps things stable, this real estate project could drive significant EPS growth over the next few years as homes are built and sold. We’re talking hundreds of millions in potential revenue over the life of the project.

# C. Balance Sheet

* **Land Holdings**: Their real estate holdings are a huge hidden asset. The market hasn’t fully priced in the long-term value of these assets. This land is strategically located in high-demand areas—prime for development as housing demand grows in California.
* **Low Debt Levels**: Limoneira has maintained manageable debt, which is crucial for a company balancing real estate projects and agribusiness. Their debt load is aligned with their growth strategy, and they’ve got the flexibility to expand without straining their balance sheet.

# Growth Catalysts

# A. Global Citrus Demand

* **Rising Consumption**: The global demand for citrus, particularly lemons, is growing due to increasing health consciousness and their use in beverages, food, and cosmetics. Limoneira’s strong export presence gives them international growth potential, particularly in emerging markets like Asia, where demand is expanding rapidly.

# B. Real Estate Development

* **Ongoing Project Phases**: As they continue to develop Harvest at Limoneira, you’ll start seeing big one-time revenue bumps when properties are sold. And remember, this isn’t just a one-and-done project—there’s room for expansion and more developments once this is complete.

# C. Sustainability Trends

* **ESG Investing**: More institutional investors are pouring capital into companies with strong ESG profiles, and Limoneira’s solar energy investments and sustainable farming practices make them a prime candidate. This could lead to increased demand for their stock as more ESG funds look to invest in companies like Limoneira.

# Valuation Metrics

* **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Limoneira’s P/B ratio is currently sitting at a point that suggests its assets—especially their real estate holdings—are undervalued. As the market begins to fully realize the potential of their land and real estate projects, we could see significant multiple expansion.
* **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Their current P/E might seem high for an agribusiness, but remember—this isn’t just an agriculture play. As real estate revenues kick in, that P/E is likely to drop significantly, boosting the stock price.

# Risks (Bear Case)

# A. Agricultural Volatility

* **Weather Dependency**: Agriculture always has risks related to weather—drought, storms, etc. But Limoneira mitigates this with geographically diverse farmland, spreading their risk across multiple regions and climates.
* **Labor Costs**: California’s rising labor costs could pressure margins, but Limoneira’s diversified revenue streams and operational efficiencies help cushion against this. 
* **Immigration Policy:** Relating to labor costs, the company does appear to rely on cheap labor supply, which are largely migrant workers. Any immigration policy that greatly impacts the ability for migrants to work in the farming industry would mean Limoneira would take a hit in terms of costs. They largely have automated the packing process, but harvest automation is still in the works and likely will not be viable in the near future.
* **HLB:** The possibility of this disease hitting Limoneira's farms are definitely not zero, this is partially why they're diversifying their cash flow with avocados, energy, and real estate.

# B. Real Estate Market Fluctuations

* **California Market Risks**: While housing demand is strong, any downturn in the California real estate market could delay profits from the Harvest project. That said, they’re in regions with steady demand, so a major downturn seems unlikely in the near future.

# Conclusion

* **Diversified Revenue Streams**: Limoneira’s balanced mix of high-demand agriculture (lemons, avocados), long-term real estate development, and sustainability initiatives makes them a versatile play. You’ve got both short-term and long-term growth potential here.
* **Undervalued Real Estate**: The real estate projects aren’t fully priced into the stock right now. When those revenues start hitting, the upside potential could be substantial. Limoneira’s land holdings are a massive asset that’s flying under the radar for many investors.
* **Sustainability Focus**: ESG-focused investing is growing, and Limoneira’s renewable energy initiatives and water conservation efforts make them an attractive target for those big ESG funds looking for solid companies in agriculture and real estate.

58,2024-09-17,97,"How would you value Coinbase? For starters, I think the difference in price and value with Coinbase stock is huge. I keep seeing it mentioned as 'cheap' because of the 30x P/E ratio. But that is way off.

Here are a few key metrics showing conflicting signals:

1. The stock is trading at a $40b market cap with \~$3b in annual sales. Earnings are very volatile and cash flows are inconsistent.
2. The business is asset-light but the custody assets are consistently growing on the balance sheet. They've gone from $2b to $200b in custody assets over five years.

I know this is a momentum stock in many ways. Even though the crypto hype has slowed down, prices have doubled since last year. More money chasing fewer assets.

$160 per share is rich. The stock price can get cut in half and I would still think it's expensive. But they have somehow combined 3-4 very valuable business models: a financial exchange, custody assets, software products and asset management.

I don't care for the typical valuation methods. Not even comparables are applicable here. Only ICE, Nasdaq, CBOE and CMOE are similar but each has a different specialty. Even sum-of-parts would be interesting but would require constant updates. Which is useless because crypto momentum and volatility have a life of their own.

Tell me how you would value this stock. What would you need to see to de-risk this as an investment?

P.S. Coinbase has been on my radar because of the recent regulatory progress. Their legal team is crushing it. First, they're spending \~$20m YTD to provide more clarity for investors. Second, this will secure their leadership position along with some regulatory capture. It's a winning position from my perspective. But entry point still matters."

&#x200B;

*Summary*

* *Core price measures eases to a 40-month low in Aug*
* *Consumer prices deflate in Aug on a monthly basis*
* *Rents rise by 8.9% in Aug from 8.5% in July*

&#x200B;

*Canada's annual inflation rate reached the central bank's target in August at it cooled to 2%, its lowest level since February 2021, data showed on Tuesday.*

*The closely watched core price measures also cooled to their lowest level in 40 months while month-on-month consumer prices deflated by 0.2%, Statistics Canada said.*

*Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the consumer price index (CPI) to cool to 2.1% from 2.5% in July on an annual basis, and expected it to be unchanged on a monthly basis.*

*The easing of price pressures was primarily helped by a drop in prices of gasoline, telephone services and clothing and footwear, while shelter costs - mortgage and rents - continued to cool at a tepid pace as rents continued their relentless rise.*

*At the Bank of Canada's monetary policy decision announcement earlier this month Governor Tiff Macklem had said the bank has to increasingly guard against the risk that inflation could fall below its target as economic growth was weak.*

*The BoC has reduced its key policy rate three times in a row from June, cutting by a cumulative 75 basis point to 4.25%.*

*Money markets are fully pricing in 25 basis point rate cuts twice in as many monetary policy meetings remaining in the year, but economists say that chances of a jumbo 50 basis point cut this year is gradually building up.*

*The BoC had predicted annual inflation to be at 2.6% this year and fall to 2.4% next year before coming down to its mid-point of the target range of 1-3% in 2026.*

*CPI-median - or the price change located in the middle of the CPI basket - slowed to 2.3% in August from 2.4% in July annually. CPI-trim - which excludes the most and the least volatile price items - cooled to 2.4% from 2.7%.*

*Gasoline prices, which contributed the most to the fall in inflation, fell by 5.1% and clothing and footwear fell by 4.4%.*

*Shelter costs, which accounts for close to 30% of the CPI basket, rose by 5.2% in August, from 5.7% in July, primarily led by rents which rose by 8.9% from 8.5% in July.*"

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street awaits retail sales data, Fed policy meeting: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street readied for key retail sales data and the start of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 added 0.4%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.6%. Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 131 points, or 0.3%.
*****
> Microsoft rose 2% after the tech giant hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.7% to 83 cents per share. The company also approved a $60 billion buyback program.
*****
> Intel shares popped about 7% in premarket trading after the company said it plans to make its foundry business a subsidiary. The Biden administration also awarded the company up to $3 billion in funding through the Chips Act.
*****
> Investors on Tuesday will parse retail sales data for August for one final glimpse into the health of the U.S. consumer ahead of the Fed rate decision. Economists polled by Dow Jones are bracing for a 0.2% decline. Excluding autos, they see a 0.2% gain. The results could affect the rate cut outcome.
*****
> Wall Street is on standby for the Fed’s long-anticipated rate cut, a move that could help boost earnings growth for companies following a backdrop of steep borrowing costs and high inflation. The Fed first embarked on its aggressive hiking campaign in March 2022.
*****
> While Wall Street expects a cut Wednesday, the market is divided on the size of the potential reduction. Traders are currently pricing in a 67% chance that the central bank eases rates by 50 basis points, according to CME Group’s Fed Watch tool. That’s up from a roughly 47% chance Friday.
*****
> “Market expectations are split between a 25 basis point and a 50 basis point rate cut, as the decision is complicated by conflicting signals of solid economic activity but a weakening labor market,” said Principal Asset Management’s Seema Shah. “Rarely have market expectations been so torn, so close to a [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting.”
*****
> While a 50 basis point cut isn’t out of the question, the chief global strategist thinks that the Fed should take a more cautious approach to cutting and ease rates by 25 basis points. She is forecasting additional 25 basis point cuts in November and December.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a mixed trading session. The 30-stock Dow rose more than 228 points, or 0.55%, to close at a record high, while the S&P 500 added 0.13%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.52% as Apple and prominent chip stocks declined.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Im pretty new to stock trading, in fact, I just did my first deposit and I plan to slowly trade with it and make it grow, I have quite a lot of experience in Forex swing trading and I planned to do the same in stocks, I heard a lot of people just DCA when position goes against them and Im not sure if this is even a good idea (But to be fair it was one of my initial plans)
My initial idea was to find undervalued stocks (Ha, I don’t even know how to search for them) Purchase them when criteria aligns and DCA when criteria happens again if it kept going against me (which could mean waiting weeks or months for another entry) and add to positions in profit without adding any risk by protecting the new positions (In the same way you DCA and exit at breakeven when position recovers but in the opposite way…) The whole idea is not to just let losers run and cut the winners but also let the winners run and even add positions to them, to even a bit the balance…

I have some questions…

Just by technical analysis can you make profit on long term positions? If no, what usually people look appart ok “trusting” or “hoping” this specific company will perform better in the future?

is there any good material looking for long term investment strategies? Is it just better to invest in an index and forget?

How usually people find good stocks or undervalued stocks? Basically opportunities to buy? Just by reading forums / news? Any good training about that?

Any feedback appreciated and thanks for reading.

545,2024-09-16,88,"U.S. Awards Intel $3 Billion for Military Supply Program The Biden administration announced on Monday that it would award Intel up to $3 billion to expand the company’s manufacturing of advanced semiconductors for the U.S. military.

The program, called Secure Enclave, aims to create a trusted source of computer chips for the U.S. government. It will be funded out of a pool of money from the 2022 bipartisan CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in an attempt to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign sources of semiconductors.

Much of the world’s semiconductors are currently made in Asia, particularly Taiwan. China claims the island as its own territory, a position that Taiwan rejects, and American officials have long had concerns about the consequences for the U.S. economy and military if China were to invade Taiwan.

Intel officials said on Monday that the company would help “secure the domestic chip supply chain” and work with federal officials to “enhance the resilience of U.S. technological systems.”

The announcement comes about six months after the Biden administration awarded Intel a grant of up to $8.5 billion to help the company fund major construction projects in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. That money, along with the award announced Monday, stems from a $39 billion pot of CHIPS Act funding intended to encourage companies to build and expand semiconductor plants across the United States.

Federal officials also awarded Intel up to $11 billion in loans, and the company is expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of its U.S. expansion projects, which are expected to cost more than $100 billion over five years.

303,2024-09-16,147,"Intel stock jumps on plan to turn foundry unit into subsidiary, allow outside funding Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsinger’s effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.

Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to “evaluate independent sources of funding,” and comes days after Intel’s board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.

Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.

With a standalone “operating board” and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.

Intel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

Intel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany “by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand,” Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.

The company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.

Intel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.

The move is a vote of confidence in Intel’s quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.

It extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.

It also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidia’s general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the company’s 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMC’s forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMC’s 3nm process are shipping now in Apple’s iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio that’s currently under construction.

“All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that’s the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we’re capable of achieving,” Gelsinger said.

5,2024-09-16,14,"Does it make sense to sell Put options if I want to create a position in a company? Let’s say I want to own 100 shares of X company trading at 100$ and I have to cash to purchase 100 shares at 100$.

Would it make sense to sell a naked put option with strike of 100$ expiring weekly.

Scenario I can think of:

1. Price goes above 100$ EOW
2. Price goes below 100$ EOW
3. Price stays 100$ EOW

Scenario 1.
Can have 2 situations 
1. Price goes above strike plus premium. 
2. Price goes above strike but less than premium 
In situation 1 I lose out on potential gains if I owned shares at 100$
In situation 2 I gain the premium plus strike minus current price of stock.
I will not own any shares EOW and I come out with profit!

Scenario 2.
2 situations
1. Price goes below strike minus premium 
2. Price goes below strike but not minus premium

In situation 1 I will get exercised and have cost basis of strike minus premium and fees right? And so I’ll be holding the shares like I want but from strike instead of market price. 
I come out at a loss here and shares EOW.

In situation 2 I will get exercised but my premium received will be greater than the loss I have per share from strike price. 
So I come out with a smaller profit than scenario 1 and shares EOW.

Scenario 3.
I make the premium and get exercised. Basically scenario 2 situation 2 right? Minus fees.

Am I missing anything important here?

I see 5 outcomes and only 1 outcome at a loss and 1 outcome with missed gains.

And since I already want to own shares I don’t really see being exercised as too bad unless the shares tanked so much in 1 week that changes my thesis on the company. 

Should one do this on a weekly basis and collect premium instead of buying the shares?"
212,2024-09-16,67,"FDA clears Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature for use. Here’s how it works The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday cleared Apple
’s new sleep apnea detection feature for use, which means it will come to the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 later this month. 

Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that causes a person’s breathing to repeatedly stop and start throughout the night. The condition affects more than 30 million people in the U.S., but only around 6 million are diagnosed, according to the American Medical Association. If it goes untreated, sleep apnea can cause fatigue and lead to more serious health issues like heart problems, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. 

“We are so excited about the incredible impact this feature can make for the millions of people living with undiagnosed sleep apnea,” Dr. Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple, said in the feature’s launch video.

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature marks the company’s latest attempt to position its wearables as a cheaper, simpler alternative to many existing health-care tests and devices. And the sleep disorder market could prove to be lucrative. 

To get evaluated for sleep apnea, for instance, patients typically participate in an at-home test or an in-lab test where they’re monitored overnight. Prices vary depending on insurance coverage, but the average in-lab test costs $3,000, according to a 2022 study in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health. 

At-home tests are often less expensive, but they can still cost hundreds of dollars. The at-home sleep apnea test from Sleep Doctor costs $189, for example. Apple’s newest watch, the Series 10, starts at $399. 

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature is “potentially a game changer” for patients who have been reluctant to seek out testing, said Dr. David Kuhlmann, a physician who has treated sleep disorders for nearly two decades in Missouri. Kuhlmann also serves on the board of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which is a professional society for sleep medicine clinicians.  

Kuhlmann said the feature could be especially helpful for patients who sleep alone, and he thinks a lot of people will be surprised to find out they’re showing signs of sleep apnea.  

Even so, Kuhlmann said users should approach Apple’s sleep apnea data with some caution, as readings could be erroneous. He said it is unlikely that insurance companies will begin paying for sleep apnea therapies like CPAP machines based on Apple Watch data alone, which is why it is important for patients to follow up with their healthcare providers to get an official diagnosis. 

“People do need to be diagnosed in order to be treated,” Kuhlmann told CNBC in an interview. 

Kuhlmann said the feature will likely cause an increase in visits to health care providers, which could ultimately reduce costs for U.S. the health-care system overall. Ideally, if patients catch sleep apnea earlier, they can avoid paying for treatments for more serious conditions down the line.

“By finding out that they have these underlying sleep disorders and getting them treated, it could potentially actually help save expenses and help improve quality of life.”

How it works 

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature works by analyzing a new metric that the company calls “breathing disturbances.” The Apple Watch identifies breathing disturbances by using an accelerometer to measure movements at the wrist that indicate disruptions to normal breathing patterns. 

Users can view their nightly metrics in the Health app, where they’ll be classified as either “elevated” or “not elevated,” i.e., normal. Apple will analyze this breathing disturbance data once a month and notify people if they show “consistent signs” of severe or moderate sleep apnea. Users can view their data over a one-month, six-month or one-year period. 

The Apple Watch Series 10 supports an 18-hour battery life, so people who are interested in using this feature will likely need to charge their device during the day.

Apple can also generate a report that users can bring to their doctors to discuss next steps. The report includes three months’ worth of breathing disturbance data as well as some additional information, the company said. Users can access educational materials within the Health app as well. 

Apple said the notification algorithm was developed with “an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests,” and that the feature was validated in a clinical study.

“Now I’m jonesing to get an Apple [Watch] so I can try it out on myself,” Kuhlmann said.

188,2024-09-16,288,"Why are automaker stocks SO cheap? So I understand that the business of making cars isn’t a great one. Very capital intensive, low margins, tons of competition. But the valuations are ridiculously low, and I’m curious if someone has an explanation.

GM - 5.2x earnings

Volkswagen - 3.4x earnings

BMW - 4.54x earnings

Stellantis - 3.2x earnings

These are lower valuations than the forward multiple on Xerox, a company that’s obviously headed towards bankruptcy. A company that borrows money to pay its dividend. I can kinda understand the valuation for Stellantis as a lot of their brands are not doing well. But BMW and Volkswagen? Are they really doing this poorly? Keep in mind that VW owns Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, etc.

Now that I provided all the details, my burning questions are following:

* **Should I make any changes to the allocation or it looks fine? Maybe put 100% funds into the Large U.S. Equity? Or Better diversify across all types of funds?**
* **Going over many reddit posts and youtube videos, it is recommend to have almost 100% invested into the equity and 5% to the bond or maybe not all to the bond. And what is your opinion about not putting money at all into the International equity fund? Feeling like I am answering my own questions haha.**
* **Last but not least, should I keep Alight managing this allocation or start managing it myself to avoid the fees?**

Advanced apologies for asking any stupid questions lol as I am new in this territory. Please let me know if you need any clarifications. I'll do my best to respond to it. Thanks and looking forward to hearing you soon."

29,2024-09-16,59,"Office REITs- opportunity of the century? There's a saying, ""Be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy"", and it's very clear that the market is very fearful of offices right now, but very greedy with the broader market(especially AI). Many office REITs are trading for pennies on the dollar, at 1-2X their annual cash flows, meanwhile the S&P500 P/E ratio is about 30.

While the pandemic did temporarily reduce office demand due to work from home, most organizations are forcing employees back to the office at least part time.

As a result of the work from home trend, construction of new offices has stalled, and some offices have been converted to other uses such as mixed use/residential. So supply of offices is stagnating, while demand is stabilizing. The only reason vacancy is growing is because tenants with 5-10 year leases are not renewing based on decreases in utilization that happened in 2020. But as the last of these leases signed pre-2020 expire, vacancies should stop increasing.

The crazy think is office rents don't even have to climb to make a ton of money on this. You can literally just buy a REIT with a 50% FFO yield, and it pays for itself in 2 years.

The main key is to find REITs that are trading at a low Price/FFO, and that have low amounts of debt. Then calculate how much their revenues would need to decline for the investment to fail.

The math is quite staggering, a lot of these REITs appear to be priced on the assumption that they will lose 70-80% of their tenants within the next 5 years, will be unable to find new ones, won't be able to sell the property, and that interest rates will remain elevated. I just don't see that being likely unless we have a great-depression level economic event, or another major shift in workplace culture where WFH becomes the standard again."
347,2024-09-16,80,"Boeing freezes hiring in sweeping cost cuts as it grapples with factory worker strike Boeing announced sweeping cost cuts including a hiring freeze and a pause on nonessential staff travel to preserve cash as it deals with a strike of more than 30,000 factory workers..

Boeing factory workers, mostly in the Seattle area, started walking off the job early Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a tentative labor deal and to strike.

“We are working in good faith to reach a new contract agreement that reflects their feedback and enables operations to resume,” CFO Brian West said in a staff note on Monday. ” However, our business is in a difficult period. This strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way and we must take necessary actions to preserve cash and safeguard our shared future.”

The financial impact of the strike will depend on how long it lasts but Boeing is focused on conserving cash, West said at a Morgan Stanley conference Friday. He said the company’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, wants to get back to the bargaining table right away to reach a new deal.

On Friday, Moody’s put all of Boeing’s credit ratings on review for a downgrade and Fitch Ratings said a prolonged strike could put Boeing at risk of a downgrade. That could drive up the borrowing costs of a manufacturer that already has mounting debt.

Boeing burned about $8 billion in the first half of the year as production slowed in the wake of a near-catastrophic door-panel blowout at the start of the year.

> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.
*****
> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.
*****
> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.
*****
> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.
*****
> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.
*****
> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.
*****
> “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.

*A flurry of major central banks will hold monetary policy meetings this week, with investors bracing for interest rate moves in either direction.*

*The Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated two-day meeting, which gets underway on Tuesday, is poised to take center stage.*

*The U.S. central bank is widely expected to join others around the world in starting its own rate-cutting cycle. The only remaining question appears to be by how much the Fed will reduce rates.*

*Traders currently see a quarter-point cut as the most likely outcome, although as many as 41% anticipate a half-point move, according to the CME’s FedWatch Tool.*

*Elsewhere, Brazil’s central bank is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting across Tuesday and Wednesday. The Bank of England, Norway’s Norges Bank and South Africa’s Reserve Bank will all follow on Thursday.*

*A busy week of central bank meetings will be rounded off when the Bank of Japan delivers its latest rate decision at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Friday.*

*“We’re entering a cutting phase,” John Bilton, global head of multi-asset strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Thursday.*

*Speaking ahead of the European Central Bank’s most recent quarter-point rate cut, Bilton said the Fed was also set to cut interest rates by 25 basis points this week, with the Bank of England “likely getting in on the party” after the U.K. economy stagnated for a second consecutive month in July.*

*“We have all the ingredients for the beginning of a fairly extended cutting cycle but one that is probably not associated with a recession — and that’s an unusual set-up,” Bilton told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.”*

*“It means that we get a lot of volatility to my mind in terms of price discovery around those who believe that actually the Fed \[is\] late, the ECB \[is\] late, this is a recession and those, like me, that believe that we don’t have the imbalances in the economy, and this will actually spur further upside.”*"

Thanks.

10,2024-09-16,6,"Nordstrom JWN We’re closing in on two weeks since it was unveiled that the Nordstrom family and the Mexican department store chain Liverpool made a bid for JWN at $23/share. 
When the bid was unveiled the price of the stock was the same as the bidding price, $23. However, it’s been close to half a year since it was announced that a special committee would be made to consider a buyout offer from the family and at that time the price of the stock was $17. So, $23 actually means a 35 % premium compared to March 2024 when it was announced a buyout offer would come - but now that we have the offer six months later, it may be to the family’s own misfortune that the price has gained 35 % making the offer perhaps seem like lowballing. But, did the price actually only go up because investors knew a buyout offer was underway? No one knows but Nordstrom has outperformed peers in recent quarters and delivered on earnings when peers haven’t. Furthermore, during these six months inflation has gone down and a rate cut is imminent indicating smoother sailing for retail. 

Today, two weeks after the bid was unveiled, the price seems anchored around $23. The Board needs to approve the bid for any sale to be completed. Macy’s and Kohl’s have also received bids in recent times but in both cases there have been significant premiums ranging from 30-40 %. Both companies declined despite these premiums. Nordstrom is a little different seeing as the family owns a big part of the company. However, the Board is perfectly capable of declining offers from the family as became clear just 8 years ago when the board declined an offer from the family for $50/share. 

Opinions and ideas on what’s going to happen to JWN in the days, weeks, months and years to come? Will the Board accept $23? If not, what will that do to the price of the stock? Will it crash or be unaffected? "

* $3.5B military contract
* NVDA and Apple kindly 'nudged' to use Intel foundaries (instead of TSMC). This will be fun!

A lot of it seems like a government bailout, because chips are soooo strategic, critical, etc. That's what you get when people who think ""*files are in the cloud, up above*"" in literal sense, have too much legislative powers. But that's good news for a dinosaur company at least in the short term.

Besides, the company is exploring strategic options like selling parts of its business and scrapping some projects. The stock's price has already declined significantly since Intel reported its latest earnings in August, and it's one of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks of the year. Yet, it's holding onto its place in the blue-chip Dow Jones index. The company is also exploring potential partnerships and acquisitions to strengthen its business.

160,2024-09-15,129,"What's wrong with this 0dte strategy?
 Say you have a budget of $1000. You buy $100 SPY/QQQ calls every day. Most will go to 0 but if the move is towards the upside (and stocks/options tend to convex to the upside) you would see a huge gain.

The math comes to you needing a 10x move at least 1/10 times to break even.

What do you think?

**UPDATE**

I never said this was some genius strategy but a lot of these comments are truly dumb.

1. there is no theta. It's 0dte.
2. there is no assignment. you are buying the call
3. there is no tits up/ lose it all scenario...since you only lose that one small bet at any given time.
4. strike price blah blah doesnt matter since you are betting on direction - however i guess it ideally has to be close to in the money for it to actually have a chance to make a big jump

How you actually lose: by bleeding out. by winning less than your starting principal. so the calculus is if you can expect to make more than $1000 over 10 bets on avg or not."

* **The major holder of $DJT said:  I will not sell. This being Trump, those that own the stock should think about the scenarios** 
   1. Trump will SELL (all or a very large portion) a week or so before the election, as he knows his company has little to zero value, especially if he loses.
   2. Trump is a man of his word, he will not sell 

* **Trump wins**
   * This stock will see 40$ - 80$ overnight. If he has sold, nobody will care. 
* **Trump loses**
   * His fans will lose fortunes.  There will be no consequence for Trump as this is his last political hurrah. 



* **Thoughts to consider**
   1. Would Trump pass on 1 billion (or more) if he knows that a negative election result will send the stock below 10$, or more likely below 5$ ? 
   2. Would Trump take the risk in a 50/50 win chance scenario of losing billions?  Or would he do as traders do?  Secure profits. 
   3. Trump is a businessman, he  does not do Charity (if anything his family/org is convicted of stealing from Cancer Kids Charity).  So, will he care about his fans/supporters?  

My theory is that the stock will rise into election day, if the polls are indicating a tight race or a lead.  A good entry point would be, I guess 15$.  Trade up to 25$ (or so) and take the investment out. Let the rest run, and sell at 46 (as a hommage to Biden).

329,2024-09-15,152,"Apple the new healthtech giant? 
This week they launched the Hearing Aid feature, which lets AirPods essentially double up as listening devices plus hearing aids; at a fraction of conventional aids. Assuming it works as Apple claims, this is a crazy opportunity for them to disrupt a legacy market that is so rooted in tradition that I didn't even know could be disrupted. A successful product would mean a durable revenue stream in an increasingly comprehensive wearables portfolio for years to come. Bonus points, it's Apple's first real consumer product innovation in years.

Yet, the stock closed nearly flat on Monday (its launch event day); and I would attribute most of the week's gain to broader cycles rather than anything directly related to the company's fundamentals. My guess would be that Apple/market had pinned its entire Glowtime event on AI integration with the iPhone, tbh it wasn't that spectacular and this might have overshadowed the hearing aids announcement.

0,2024-09-15,52,"Mathematically speaking is there a way to find an infinite money glitch if you have access to purchase both an asset and the short of that a Say you have an asset like stock ""A"" and that stock ""A"" is currently $10 a share. Within a brokerage you can buy many of stock ""A"". There is also a short of stock ""A"" that goes up 2X as fast as stock ""A"" goes down. When stock ""A"" has a bad day you would want to hold this short. For simplicity we will call the short of stock ""A"" as ABC stock.

My friend and I are both math nerds but would like to know if there is truly an infinite money glitch if you have access to both the stock and short of the stock? Does the short of the stock being 2X affect anything more or less than if the short was only going up exactly in line (1X) of the price of the stock?

More specifically as some of you are probably aware you can put in limit orders to buy a stock only if the stock price drops to being at or below a certain price. You also could buy using a trailing stop loss, so if and only iff the stock price drops 3% from the current or future price it will trigger a buy order.

Came across a formula that obviously was not totally accurate but maybe with some changes it could be either at or near a money glitch to always make money, granted you would need to go in every few days and put in the orders once the buy and/or sale happens. Mind you this assumes a person has +$25k in their account to do unlimited day trades."
33,2024-09-14,248,"Why Is the S&P 500 so Bullish? Hey everyone,

I've been closely following the current economic indicators and I'm puzzled by the S&P 500 reaching new all-time highs. I broke up my logic into individual points:

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation Forecasts indicate that inflation remains stubbornly high. High inflation typically reduces consumer purchasing power and can squeeze corporate profit margins, which university theory says that these should pressure stock prices downward. Is this no longer the case?




The Federal Reserve has as we all know raised interest rates to combat inflation the past year or so. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, which slow economic growth and make equities less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Now this often isn't reflected in financial statements right away, it takes time for the effects of interest rates to effect the bottomline. You don't really notice until you start paying the cumulative interest.




Wall Street has been saying there's a 50% chance of a 0.5 rate cut pricing it into the market if the Fed decides to pause or reverse its tightening measures. If the Fed doesn’t act as expected, this uncertainty could lead to a tremendous oopsie daisy that no one seems to be talking about. When has the Fed acted in the interest of the equities market? They work for the government.




Youth unemployment rates ain't looking so good and there's a rising sense of generational hopelessness present in pop culture and everyday narratives.High youth unemployment can lead to reduced consumer spending which is pretty surface level, but on a large scale, doesn't this also lead to a reduced savings rate, less investments and therefore less money flowing into companies who need to maintain a large price



Now obviously these are a few off the top of my head examples pointing to the negative so I'm asking you to offer a counter-argument.


Why do YOU believe the S&P 500 is continuing to climb to new heights?

Are strong corporate earnings or future growth expectations counterbalancing these negative factors?

Are there international developments or global market trends supporting the S&P 500's rise?

Is the anticipation of future rate cuts fueling buying behavior now?

0,2024-09-14,47,"NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis | Thematics # Background

 The AI scaling hypothesis is a key concept in artificial intelligence research that suggests improvements in AI capabilities can be achieved primarily by increasing the size and computational resources of AI models. We can understand several aspects of this hypothesis:

Key Points of the AI Scaling Hypothesis

1. **Emergence of Capabilities**: As AI models grow larger and are trained on more data, they tend to develop new capabilities that were not explicitly programmed. This emergence of novel abilities is a central tenet of the scaling hypothesis.
2. **Generalization**: Larger models demonstrate improved ability to generalize across different tasks and domains, often showing surprising competence in areas they were not specifically trained for.
3. **Efficiency in Learning**: Scaled-up models can learn more efficiently from limited data, sometimes matching or surpassing the performance of smaller, task-specific models with just a few examples.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The hypothesis suggests that continuing to scale up models will lead to further improvements in AI performance and capabilities, potentially approaching or even surpassing human-level abilities in various domains.

# Hyperscalers and First Mover Advantage

The scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in AI, including large language models and multimodal AI systems. However, it's important to note that while scaling has proven effective, it also comes with challenges such as increased computational requirements and potential biases in large datasets.

Hyperscalers are racing to scale their AI capabilities and be ***the first to discover emergent properties for several compelling reasons at any cost. This is the main driver in the billions of capital expenditures over the last 18 months.*** At the forefront is the significant competitive advantage that comes with pioneering new AI capabilities in the fast-evolving tech landscape. Being first allows these companies to establish market dominance, attract and retain customers seeking cutting-edge AI solutions, and gain valuable insights from early deployments. This advantage is not merely about prestige; it translates directly into substantial economic benefits.

The economic incentives driving this race are staggering. Industry projections suggest that AI technology in data centers alone could drive spending of up to $2 trillion over the next five years. Additionally, the AI silicon market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2027. These figures underscore the massive financial opportunity that awaits those who lead in AI capabilities. Hyperscalers are positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing demand for custom AI silicon and infrastructure, potentially securing a significant share of this burgeoning market.

The rush to scale is also fueled by the promise of technological breakthroughs. ***The AI scaling hypothesis suggests that continued increases in model size and computational resources will lead to the emergence of novel capabilities not explicitly programmed, improved generalization across different tasks and domains, and more efficient learning from limited data***\*.\* This potential for transformative advancements keeps hyperscalers intensely focused on pushing the boundaries of AI scale.

Hyperscalers are uniquely positioned in this race due to their existing infrastructure advantages. They possess the necessary computational resources, data centers, and cloud infrastructure that can be leveraged for AI training and deployment. This allows them to offer scalable AI services to a wide range of customers, from individuals to large enterprises, further cementing their market position.

Strategically, leading in AI capabilities allows hyperscalers to shape the future direction of AI development and applications, influence industry standards, and attract top AI talent and research partnerships. The potential for breakthrough discoveries, including the possibility of approaching or surpassing human-level abilities in various domains or even developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), adds another layer of motivation to their efforts.

# Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in artificial intelligence, but there are compelling arguments for how it could potentially be falsified

One primary method would be ***to demonstrate diminishing returns as models are scaled up in size and computational resources.*** ***If performance gains plateau or even decline rather than continuing to improve linearly or superlinearly, it would suggest fundamental limits to scaling***. This could be coupled with identifying qualitative gaps – cognitive abilities or tasks that larger models consistently fail at, even as they improve on other benchmarks. Such findings would indicate that some fundamental capabilities are missing and cannot be addressed by pure scaling alone.

# Simple Bench

Simple bench is the only reasoning benchmark written in natural language at which English-speaking humans (and yes, even 'smart highschoolers') can score 90%+, while frontier LLMs get less than 50%. It is an encapsulation of the reasoning deficit found in AI like ChatGPT.

 What the benchmark does is take a standard kind of logic puzzle that people ask LLM's, then spikes it with a ""surprise twist"" that requires what we would think of as common sense.  Thus an AI has more difficulty in predicting the next tokens because of the twist.  But humans can still reason out an answer.

These questions are fully private, preventing contamination, and have been vetted by PhDs from multiple domains, as well as the author - Philip, from AI Explained - who first exposed the numerous errors in the MMLU (Aug 2023). \[https://simple-bench.com/about.html\]

***These large AI companies don’t disclose training parameter sizes because we can graph training size vs benchmark score to falsify the scalability hypothesis.***

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind significant advancements in artificial intelligence, propelling the development of increasingly powerful models and fueling a race among hyperscalers to achieve breakthrough capabilities. This hypothesis has led to remarkable improvements in AI performance across various domains, from natural language processing to computer vision and beyond.

However, as we delve deeper into the realm of large-scale AI models, we are beginning to encounter signs that suggest the scaling hypothesis may have limitations. The emergence of benchmarks like Simple Bench, which reveal persistent reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, indicates that simply increasing model size and computational resources may not be sufficient to achieve human-level reasoning capabilities.

The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models adds another layer of intrigue to this discussion. ***This lack of transparency makes it challenging for the broader scientific community to accurately assess the relationship between model scale and performance, potentially hindering efforts to validate or falsify the scaling hypothesis.***

Moreover, the increasing costs associated with training and deploying ever-larger models, coupled with concerns about data scarcity and computational limitations, raise questions about the long-term sustainability of the scaling approach. As we approach these practical and theoretical limits, it becomes clear that the future of AI advancement may require more than just scaling up existing architectures.

Looking ahead, the field of AI research may need to pivot towards more innovative approaches that focus on qualitative improvements in model architecture, training methodologies, and data utilization. The development of more sophisticated benchmarks, like Simple Bench, that can effectively measure complex reasoning abilities will be crucial in guiding these efforts.

Ultimately, while the scaling hypothesis has undoubtedly driven remarkable progress in AI, its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. The next frontier in AI research may lie not in building ever-larger models, but in developing more efficient, adaptable, and truly intelligent systems that can match or exceed human-level reasoning across a wide range of tasks. This shift could lead to a new paradigm in AI development, one that combines the insights gained from scaling with novel approaches to create more capable and robust artificial intelligence.

# AI Bubble Collapse and Trillions in Misallocated Capital

 The AI scaling hypothesis has been the cornerstone of recent advancements in artificial intelligence, driving unprecedented investments and fueling a race among tech giants to build ever-larger models. However, as we stand on the precipice of a potential paradigm shift, the falsification of this hypothesis could trigger a seismic disruption in the AI industry, potentially leading to the collapse of what many now recognize as an AI bubble.

The signs of this impending crisis are becoming increasingly apparent. Benchmarks like Simple Bench are exposing critical reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, defying the expectation that larger models inherently lead to more intelligent systems. The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models further fuels suspicion that the relationship between scale and performance may not be as straightforward as once believed.

 As the evidence mounts against the scaling hypothesis, we must confront the sobering reality of the potential misallocation of trillions of dollars in capital. Hyperscalers and investors have poured vast resources into the development of massive data centers, custom AI chips, and enormous models, all predicated on the belief that bigger is inherently better. If this foundational assumption proves false, the repercussions will be far-reaching and profound.

The collapse of the AI bubble, triggered by the falsification of the scaling hypothesis, could lead to:

1.  A dramatic reassessment of the valuations of AI-focused companies, potentially wiping out billions in market capitalization.

2.  A crisis of confidence in the AI industry, leading to a sharp decline in investment and a potential ""AI winter.""

**This potential collapse serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of putting too much faith in a single hypothesis**, no matter how compelling it may seem. It underscores the critical importance of diverse approaches in AI research and the need for rigorous, independent verification of claims made by industry leaders.

306,2024-09-13,56,"Verizon puts price tag on buyouts and says nearly 5,000 employees are leaving Verizon Communications Inc. said Thursday it expects charges of up to $1.9 billion in its third quarter in connection with employee buyouts.

About 4,800 employees will leave the telecommunications giant by March under the voluntary separation program that Verizon announced in June. Half of those employees are leaving in September, the company said.

Verizon said that it expects to record severance charges in a range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, or $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in after-tax charges, in the third quarter.

In a filing in February, Verizon said it had about 105,400 full-time employees as of December, with 89% of them based in the U.S.

Verizon also said that as part of ongoing cost-savings initiatives, it plans to stop using certain offices and leave “non-strategic portions” of certain businesses, without giving more details.

As a result, it also expects to record asset and business rationalization charges in the range of $230 million to $380 million, or $170 million to $290 million after tax, in the quarter.

Analysts polled by FactSet expect Verizon to report in mid-October adjusted earnings of $1.18 a share on sales of $33.7 billion for its third quarter.

In the third quarter of 2023, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on sales of $33.3 billion.

Verizon earlier this month announced plans to buy Frontier Communications Parent Inc. in a $20 billion all-cash deal, a play for a fiber-internet provider in the U.S.

Verizon shares have gained more than 15% this year, slightly underperforming an advance of around 16% for the S&P 500

For example my cousin is a big Apple person (Iphone, Apple Watch, Apple TV etc) and is a shopaholic at Ulta. So she purchases stocks of these companies.  She says she doesn't care about the stock performance that much - as these companies provide her with value and satisfaction in her life. 

In a way, like trying to recover the cost for the several Iphones she has bought since the start. 

But when I asked her about Reddit... something she uses, she is iffy about purchasing the stock.  Her reasoning is, its offerings is not tangible.. so she is not sure how the company really makes money.  Even with ads propping up, she isn't sold ... for now.

I personally have bought some RDDT stocks because I use it often and feel like I owe it back if that makes sense.

Ok question for those that have the mindset more like my cousin or in general don't see a pathway to solid profitability.

>Scenerio: If RDDT couldn't continue to operate due to lack of ads profit and mediocre stock performance. Would you buy some of its stocks... help raise capital and keep it above water?

I don't believe it will happen, but man it be a bummer if it ever went under.

306,2024-09-13,104,"Saudi Arabia expects to get access to Nvidia's high performance chips 'within the next year' Saudi Arabia is optimistic about gaining access to U.S. chipmaker Nvidia's high-performance chips, which would enable it to develop and operate the most advanced artificial intelligence models.

Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, a top official at the Saudi Data and AI Authority, Abdulrahman Tariq Habib, said the kingdom expected to make such a stride in the next year.


""I think within the next year,"" Habib, Deputy CEO of SDAIA's strategy management office, told CNBC's Dan Murphy after being asked about a potential timeline. It's a significant expectation given that the United States' strict export controls have thus far prevented the chips' export to the kingdom. Habib made the comments on the sidelines of GAIN, Saudi Arabia's international AI summit, which took place in Riyadh this week.

It ""will mean a lot"" for Saudi Arabia to have access to the chips, Habib said — in this case, the Nvidia H200s, the firm's most powerful chips, which are used in OpenAI's GPT-4o.

""It will ease business between Saudi and U.S.,"" he said. ""It will also open a lot of doors for building the capability, the computational capabilities, in the kingdom. But most importantly, it's not only the computational capability that's important. We worked hard in the past three years in building capacity, in human capacity, we also build data capacity as well. So we are working and collaborating with all [of the] international community and contributing [to] be one of the top active countries in data analysis.""


Saudi Arabia is pouring considerable investment into developing a robust AI ecosystem in the kingdom, disclosing in a report by SDAIA that it aims to have AI make up 12% of its gross domestic product by 2030. According to the report, published on Sept. 9, the kingdom's $925 billion Public Investment Fund will lead the investment.

10,2024-09-13,20,"Altimmune or Viking? The Obesity hype. $VKTX vs $ALT The Obesity Hype. A real hype that can blow portfolios more so than AI, look at the Viking stock trajectory. To figure out the science, is hard.

I am not saying buy this stock. I am saying, verify the below comparison with somebody. If the below is correct. You did your DD.

1. **Why $ALT over $VKTX?**
   * VKTX-2735 < PEMVI 2.4mg -- PEMVI superior quality of Weight Loss as measured by % FAT vs. % LEAN reduction (i.e. the KEY next-gen GLP1 metric)
   * PEMVI broad CARDIOVASCULAR activity/potential
   * PEMVI MOA includes Thermogenic/RMR component for LT use
   * PEMVI body recomp. potential via class-leading lean muscle preservation
   * PEMVI P3 titration/DR design to 'fix' outlier 48wk P2 (other PEMVI studies have shown tolerability on par with VK2735)
   * VK2735 is faster WL which is better for BMI 40+ class 3 Obesity (smaller market), but not for avg. person -- VK to compete with $LLY Zep,
   * PEMVI is SIGNIFICANTLY differentiated high quality Next-gen GLP1 WL
   * VKTX-2809 < PEMVI 1.8mg -- PEMVI rapid liver defatting in 6-12 wks (MASLD)
   * PEMVI better 24wk anti-fibrotic potential vs 52wk VKTX
   * PEMVI bypasses thyroid and is leading GLP1 liver MOA
2. **Why is Viking valued at 50$ and Altimmune at 6$?**
   * Viking Management simply is better at managing their stock. Viking has 900 million in cash, which they simply raised in a brilliant way.
   * Altimmune had some set-backs in the past, which may make WS suspicious.
   * Altimmune had a short report to endure, in which Kerrisdale stupidly rehashed old data, BUT Altimmune management FAILED at protecting the stock they let Jefferies do their bidding, plus their cash runway is not convincing. Their only response was a meaningless Tweet.
   * Altimmune cash runway 150 million (or so), they stupidly ran the ATM at the absolute wrong moment.
   * Altimmune is stupidly promising a partner for over a year now, and have not delivered.
3. **But why is Altimmune still the better stock?**
   * Pemvi as explained above, is smarter. Not Obesity, but curative fatty liver - COVERED BY INSURANCE ALREADY. Which pure obesity drugs are not, like Zepbound Wegovy
   * Altimmune has FAST TRACK status. A nugget overseen by many
   * Altimmune has a much much larger upside, at this moment. The odds of Viking crashing, extremely high. They are a Bio, they will face a setback. I believe if Viking was to be bought now, it would be at 100$ per share
   * If Altimmune was to be bought now, 40$-75$ per share would be fair.
   * If Altimmune announces a partner, it will likely be a 20$ 30$ stock within days."
218,2024-09-13,83,"Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-sharing trips in Austin and Atlanta  Uber announced Friday it is expanding its partnership with Alphabet’s Waymo to offer robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta beginning in early 2025. Shares of Uber jumped 5% on the news while Alphabet rose about 1%.

Uber riders in those cities can be matched with a driverless Waymo car for some trips, according to the companies. The rides will only be available through Uber’s app, unlike in San Francisco and Los Angeles where riders book through the Waymo app. A Waymo spokesperson said it had no plans to partner with Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The expansion comes as Uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla’s planned robotaxi event slated for Oct. 10. Shares of Uber have fallen 9% since the Tesla event was announced and are off 17% from their 52-week highs. 

It may also slow Waymo encroachment into Uber’s market share. An analysis from Bernstein estimated that, as of May 2024, Waymo’s 50,000 weekly paid rides made up approximately 2% of ride-sharing usage in San Francisco. Since then, Waymo has doubled its paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 a week, the company announced. 

“We’re thrilled to build on our successful partnership with Waymo, which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in Phoenix,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. 

Uber’s initial agreement with Waymo in Phoenix also included autonomous Uber Eats deliveries in the city. The expansion into Austin and Atlanta won’t include Uber Eats at first, according to the Waymo spokesperson, but they’re exploring that possibility for the future. 

Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said, “We’ve been delighted at the positive feedback from our Waymo One riders to date, and we can’t wait to bring the comfort, convenience, and safety of the Waymo Driver to these cities in partnership with Uber.” 

The expansion into two more cities is another step in Uber’s advancement into the robotaxi space, after struggling to get a foothold and selling off its own self-driving division in 2020, now relying on partnerships with companies including Waymo, GM’s Cruise and the SoftBank-backed U.K. startup Wayve to gain ground. 

Uber shares dipped in August after the company announced a multiyear partnership with Cruise to offer autonomous rides through its app next year. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski cited Cruise’s previous safety challenges as a part of the investor skepticism, along with now-fulfilled hopes for a partnership with Waymo instead. 

Waymo has rapidly made strides in the self-driving race. It currently offers robotaxi services to the public in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. It has logged more than 22 million miles through June of this year, and last week, it released a report that argued its vehicles are safer than human drivers. It began testing driverless cars on Bay Area freeways with Google employees in August.

Some analysts were more hopeful for a potential Uber and Waymo expansion into San Francisco. But Atlanta and Austin, where Waymo has already begun testing, may still help sentiment.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

- They also have a ratio of 8:1 in terms of total current assets to total current liabilities. Meaning they can payoff their short term debt 8x. This is good news. 
Id also like to add an investment piece they have “We have excluded the impact of the Shopify investment option of 15,743,174 shares at $88.93 per share as it was out of the money as of June 30, 2024. The investment option expires on July 28, 2030.”

They have a phat relationship with Shopify and are expecting to grow with them and capitalize on their company growth.

Their spending on R&D and G&A were both down by 100+ basis points on their recent earnings report. As they increased their spending on Sales and Marketing which they already stated would be happening in the previous quarters. 

TLDR: KVYO good deals, solid growth projections, great leadership/board, entry price slightly higher than IPO price, starting to dominate its industry and acquiring customers from Mailchimp.

Here’s how Adobe did for the quarter ending in August versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: $5.41 billion, vs. $5.37 billion expected

Earnings per share: $4.65, adjusted, vs. $4.53 estimated

Adobe said it expected earnings per share between $4.63 and $4.68 on revenue in the fourth quarter of between $5.5 billion and $5.55 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting a forecast of $4.67 of earnings on $5.61 billion of sales.

Adobe said it recorded $1.68 billion of net income during the quarter, or $3.76 per diluted share. That’s up from $1.40 billion, or $3.05 per share in the year-ago period.

Adobe’s biggest line of business, Digital Media, which includes the company’s Creative Cloud subscriptions that use generative AI called Firefly, grew 11% on an annual basis to sales of $4 billion.

In total, Adobe recorded $5.18 billion in subscription revenue during the quarter, up 11% year-over-year.

610,2024-09-12,227,"Google is down almost 20 percent from ATH and has entered bear market territory. my thesis Google as the title states has gone down 20 percent from the ATH which is more than other big tech companies have seen. and is now in bear market territory. 

First let's start with the balance sheet of Google which is pretty good for the most part.  Google revenue has increased at a rate of 18.16 percent a year which is extremely fast top-line growth.  Free cash flow growth has been good but more and more is going towards capx while google tries to improve their LLM.  The free cash flow is also further hurt by their stock-based comp which last year counted for nearly 32 percent of all free cash flow. EPS is going up at a rate of 21 percent in the last 5 years which is being accelerated by google buying back shares.  They have minimal debt and lots of cash. they  have recently issued a dividend which is great because it returns more profits back to shareholders.

***Why is google trading down so much***

Google has recently found itself to be a convicted monopoly by the DOJ and is also seeing regulation from the EU as well in other anti monopoly lawsuits.  This has increased the level of uncertainty in the stock because the punishments have yet to be given leaving investors in limbo of how detrimental this could actually be.

Google as well as other big tech companies have been spending ungodly amounts of money chasing AI and while I do think AI could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the future in the short term this is causing companies like Google to not be as capital efficient as they once were.

***What will cause google stock to go up***

The thesis is simple...  Once time passes and we get past these anti-trust lawsuits the future from Google will seem more clear and this will help with investor sentiment and certainty and help contribute to an increase in stock price.  Google is currently spending money on a upgrade cycle which is AI.  Once the boom for AI starts to go down, capex spending should move down, allowing Google to return to a more capital efficient business model.  Also keep in mind that Google owns so many entities (YouTube, Google Cloud, Google Search, -google office suite, and android).

TLDR: Google stock is probably undervalued and its probably gonna go up lmao

104,2024-09-12,35,"Microsoft hires former GE CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe as new operating chief  Microsoft told employees on Thursday that it has hired Carolina Dybeck Happe as its executive vice president and chief operating officer, reporting to CEO Satya Nadella. Dybeck Happe comes from GE, where she was senior vice president and chief financial officer from 2020 until September 2023.

The appointment reflects Microsoft’s commitment to ensuring it remains coordinated as so much of the company has become oriented around artificial intelligence.

She will join Microsoft’s senior leadership team alongside finance chief Amy Hood, cloud and AI engineering leader Scott Guthrie and other executives.

“Carolina will partner with the SLT to help us drive continuous business process improvement across all our organizations and accelerate our company-wide AI transformation, increasing value to customers and partners,” Nadella wrote in a memo to employees.

Nadella said Dybeck Happe will take over Guthrie’s commerce and ecosystems organization, the Microsoft Digital IT team under Office software leader Rajesh Jha and the Microsoft Business Operations unit in the finance department.

Dybeck Happe’s appointment comes months after GE’s aviation and energy businesses, known as GE Aerospace and GE Vernova respectively, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE announced plans to split into three companies in 2021.

GE CEO Larry Culp called Dybeck Happe “a high-impact executive” when GE announced in 2019 that it had picked Dybeck Happe to replace Jamie Miller as chief financial officer.

She joined GE from Maersk, where she had been finance chief. Before that, she spent almost 17 years at Swedish lock company Assa Abloy, where she became chief financial officer and deputy CEO.

Microsoft has not had an operating chief since 2016, when former Walmart executive Kevin Turner left.

241,2024-09-12,62,"Ajit Jain, Buffett's insurance chief, dumps more than half his Berkshire stake  Ajit Jain, Warren’s Buffett’s insurance chief and top executive, sold more than half of his stake in Berkshire Hathaway, a new regulatory filing showed.

The 73-year-old vice chairman of insurance operations dumped 200 shares of Berkshire Class A shares on Monday at an average price of $695,418 per share for roughly $139 million. That left him holding just 61 shares, while family trusts established by himself and his spouse for the benefit of his descendants hold 55 shares and his nonprofit corporation, the Jain Foundation, owns 50 shares. Monday’s sale represented 55% of his total stake in Berkshire.

The move marked the biggest decline in Jain’s holdings since he joined Berkshire in 1986. It’s unclear what motivated Jain’s sales, but he did take advantage of Berkshire’s recent high price. The conglomerate traded above $700,000 to hit a $1 trillion market capitalization at the end of August.

“This appears to be a signal that Ajit views Berkshire as being fully valued,” said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business. 

It’s also consistent with a significant slowdown in Berkshire’s share buyback activity as of late. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire repurchased just $345 million worth of its own stock in the second quarter, significantly lower than the $2 billion repurchased in each of the prior two quarters.

“I think at best it is a sign that the stock is not cheap,” said Bill Stone, CIO at Glenview Trust Co. and a Berkshire shareholder. “At over 1.6 times book value, it is probably around Buffett’s conservative estimate of intrinsic value. I don’t expect many, if any, stock repurchases from Berkshire around these levels.”

The India-born Jain has played a crucial role in Berkshire’s unmatched success. He facilitated a push into the reinsurance industry and more recently led a turnaround at Geico, Berkshire’s crown jewel auto insurance business. In 2018, Jain was named vice chairman of insurance operations and appointed to Berkshire’s board of directors.

“Ajit has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders,” Buffett wrote in his annual letter in 2017. “If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me for him, don’t hesitate. Make the trade!”

Before it was officially announced that Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will eventually succeed the 94-year-old Buffett, there were rumors about Jain one day leading the conglomerate. Buffett recently clarified that Jain “never wanted to run Berkshire” and there wasn’t any competition between the two.

0,2024-09-12,57,"What would I do next Wednesday if I am in Jerome Powell's position? Would I do a 25 basis points or 50 basis points cut?

1. I could go with a 25 bp cut as the most recent CPI is at 2.5% YOY, and unemployment is not terrible.  Hoping the affect of starting a rate cut in September with subsequent two more 25 bp cuts before the end of the year be enough to get the inflationary rate down to 2% in the next 12 months and not lower.  Lower inflation rate can risk into a deflation with the economy going to recession.
2. Going with a 50 bp cut in September to jump start the economy with two more 25 bp cuts before the end of this year to avoid possible deflation and ensure the economy won't spiral into a recession.
3. Going with a 25 bp cut in September and see how things go with the possibility of additional 50 bp and a 25 bp cuts before the end of the year, but that's take on some risk of the economy losing momentum by not having a 50 bp cut in September.

I would probably pick the second choice as I won't be sure how many more terms I would stay as the Fed Chairman and won't want to risk the economy to go into a recession and leaving my legacy in ruins.

But that's my opinion, and I am not Jerome Powell.  Either way, a rate cut is almost definitely in the house and the choice He/Fed made really depends on how confident and how much risk He/Fed are willing to take."

The S&P 500 ended the day higher by 1.07%, even after falling more than 1% on an intraday basis — a first for the broader index since October 2022.
*****
> At the same time, the 30-stock Dow gained 124.75 points, or 0.31%, after losing as much as 743.89 points earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite closed 2.17% higher, making a comeback from a decline of more than 1%.
*****
> Stocks dropped earlier in the day when August’s consumer price index showed an uptick in core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. The reading spooked investors hoping for a half-percentage point cut from the Federal Reserve at its Sept. 17-18 meeting.
*****
> “The inflation report that we saw today is confirming a trend that we’ve acknowledged over the past couple of months, where now that the Fed is — and I think appropriately so — focused less on inflation and more on economic growth, that completely changes market reactivity,” Lauren Goodwin, chief market strategist at New York Life Investments, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Wednesday.
*****
> “It means that now good economic news — and I would include today’s inflation report as relatively good news, a little stronger than the markets were expecting — that’s going to be good news for the market,” Goodwin continued.
*****
> Wall Street is anticipating the release of the August producer price index on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones anticipate a rise of 0.2% last month in the headline and core readings, up from 0.1% and 0.0% previously.

I have been paying attention also to AI and I’m thinking about the time that it became better at the game Go than humans. One of the elements of that situation that has stuck out in my mind is that the machines were reported to play go very differently than human competitors to a degree that the humans couldn’t understand, at least initially, the strategy.

Is it possible that there is enough control of enough money in the market by AI that the AI systems are now playing the market like they played Go? That could explain what, to me, looks like strange and unpredictable movement in the market. It is conceivable, for me at least, that the machines, if optimized a certain way or focused on certain outcomes, could create movements in the market that produced greater wealth for those employing them by, triggering sell off’s after selling high and then buying back in lower or many more things that I can’t even imagine.

I’m not making a point, I am asking questions😎"
234,2024-09-12,150,"McDonald’s to extend $5 value meal offer into December in most U.S. markets MCD rose by more than 15% since early July 2024 while US economy continues to cool off \~

Extending the value meal offer seems positive for MCD yet probably reflecting the issue arising from overall economy ...

**McDonald’s to extend $5 value meal offer into December in most U.S. markets**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/12/mcdonalds-to-extend-5-value-meal-offer-into-december.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/12/mcdonalds-to-extend-5-value-meal-offer-into-december.html)

*Key Points*

* *McDonald’s will extend its $5 value meal into December in most U.S. markets.*
* *Franchisees have been voting on extending the value meal in their local markets, and roughly 80% of local markets have opted to extend the deal into December.*
* *The restaurant sector focused on value this summer, as companies including McDonald’s, Burger King and even Starbucks attempted to lure consumers in with discounted offerings as diners cut back on restaurant spending.*

&#x200B;

*McDonald’s will extend its $5 value meal into December in most U.S. markets as it looks to win back lower-income consumers.*

*Franchisees have been voting on extending the value meal, and roughly 80% of local markets have opted to extend the deal into December. Votes on extensions are ongoing, so additional locations may be added in the weeks to come.*

*The value meal offers a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink for $5.*

*Owners will also be offering local promotions in the weeks and months to come, in addition to the value bundle, the company said. Deals will also be available in McDonald’s app.*

*“Together with our franchisees, we’re committed to keeping our prices as affordable as possible, which is why we’re doubling down with even more ways to save,” McDonald’s U.S. President Joe Erlinger said in a statement about the meal’s extension into December.*

*The restaurant sector focused on value this summer, as companies including McDonald’s, Burger King and even Starbucks attempted to lure consumers in with discounted offerings. Diners have pulled back on their restaurant spending after years of persistent inflation.*

*After McDonald’s posted declining second-quarter same-store sales in July, executives told restaurant operators and analysts the company would focus on how to recapture consumers with deals, as they pushed for an extension of the $5 value meal. The offer ran through the end of August, after 93% of restaurants had agreed to keep it on the menu following its initial four-week run in June and July.*

*In a memo to the U.S. system obtained by CNBC after the July earnings report, Erlinger said McDonald’s struggled to sell diners on affordability in the most recent quarter, adding that he expects “industry and competitive challenges” to continue throughout the year. Erlinger encouraged operators to look ahead to building momentum for next year, adding that “channeling a long-term mindset is crucial” to the company’s success.*

*“Reversing the narrative and re-establishing our position as the leader on value and affordability is possible, but it cannot be done overnight,” he wrote at the time. “It will happen through sustained and coordinated actions that show the customer we’re on their side.”*

*The $5 meal trial performed well among low-income consumers, and sentiment around the company’s value had started to improve, Erlinger said in the July memo.*"

36,2024-09-12,17,"Oracle trails only Nvidia among large-cap tech this year, as Ellison closes in on Bezos Larry Ellison turned 80 last month. It’s been a celebratory year.

While fellow legacy tech players Intel and Cisco struggle to find their footing in a world driven increasingly by the promise of artificial intelligence, Oracle has emerged as a Wall Street darling.

Following a better-than-expected [earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html) after the close on Monday, the stock popped 11% on Tuesday. It gained more steam on Wednesday, closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double-digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year, driven by the company’s cloud businesses. The stock didn’t have a single double-digit increase last year and had only one in 2022.

“The excitement is back,” Guggenheim analysts titled their post-earnings report, highlighting “momentum across all business.”

Oracle shares are now up 49% this year, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia — up 136% — among large-cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is Meta, which has gained 45%.

Intel, meanwhile, has lost 60% of its value and Cisco is down almost 3%. Both companies announced major layoffs in their earnings reports last month.

The biggest financial winner from Oracle’s rally is Ellison, who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40% of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion, according to Forbes. Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($251 billion) and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($202 billion) are wealthier.

By the standards of high-growth tech, Oracle remains fairly plodding.

Revenue increased 8% in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period, growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.

Since 2011, Oracle has had only one year of double-digit revenue growth — 18% in fiscal 2023 — and four times the company has contracted.

“After 13 years of single-digit organic total revenue growth, Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits,” JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday, bumping up their rating to buy from hold. “We remain very EPS confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth growing double digits.”

Oracle is currently in the midst of its CloudWorld conference, which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event, investors are applauding the company’s cloud story, including both its infrastructure business and its databases.

While Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45% in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion.

In addition to competing with the top cloud companies, Oracle is increasingly partnering with them.

A year ago, Ellison visited Microsoft’s headquarters outside of Seattle for the first time, announcing a collaboration with a company he’d competed with for more than 30 years.

On Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year.

“We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come,” Ellison said on Monday’s earnings call.

Oracle didn’t immediately provide a comment for this story.

# ‘No more passwords’

For years, Ellison described Oracle’s database as “autonomous,” playing into the hype around self-driving cars (he used to be on Tesla’s board and is close with Musk) and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldn’t need manual patching and wouldn’t have downtime, and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late he’s benefitted from playing nice.

After years of criticizing AWS at events, Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazon’s market-leading cloud with Oracle’s full-featured database.

“Of course, customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time,” AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third-party software, make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools, Garman said.

Garman, who replaced Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June, added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together.

As Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet, he’s now taking on passwords, which he calls “utterly ridiculous” because they’re insecure and can be “easily hacked.”

“This is the way log-on is going to work,” Ellison said on the earnings call. “I’m going to type in Larry.Ellison@oracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, ‘OK, Hi Larry.’ We’re done.”

He went on to say that Catz can recognize him as can his kids, so there’s no reason his computer shouldn’t be able to the same.

“No more passwords,” he said. “Those have got to go.”

537,2024-09-11,154,"Trump Media Stock Takes 15% Hit Post-Debate Amid Investor Concerns Over 2024 Campaign Following the recent debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the stock of Trump Media & Technology Group (parent company of Truth Social) experienced a significant decline of over 15%. Investors appeared unsettled by Trump's political performance, which has historically influenced the stock's value. Since Harris replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Trump Media’s stock has plummeted by around 60%, reflecting growing uncertainty about Trump’s political future.

Investor sentiment is increasingly tied to Trump’s election prospects. His involvement in the 2024 presidential race has led to fluctuating market reactions, particularly as political debates shape public perception. Analysts believe the stock’s value could be impacted further depending on Trump’s ability to regain political traction, which is currently under scrutiny after the debate.

The drop also highlights broader market concerns about the viability of Truth Social in an evolving media landscape. Investors are questioning its long-term profitability, especially as political shifts create volatility in Trump-affiliated ventures.

The post-debate decline signals that Trump's business interests are deeply tied to his political career, and investor confidence is wavering based on his current standing in the race.

25,2024-09-11,5,"Accidentally created wash sale I have been dabbling in LETFs for a bit but never really day traded or played options on it up until recently. I sold covered calls on SOXL, got the shares assigned .. didn't really know about rolling options up until now ended up losing those shares. I day-traded a bit after and long story short now I have a disallowed loss of about 50k. In addition I have a realized gains of about 75k. What does this mean?

Does this mean that if I have an additional profit of upto 50k on SOXL, it would cancel out against the disallowed loss? I.E. my end of the year realized gains would only be 75k (if I don't have additional losses)

Or am I screwed, and any additional profit I might have I would have to pay taxes on them on top of my realized gains of 75K?

Any help here would be appreciated. Thanks"
7,2024-09-11,16,"Is there any info that can be learned from afterhour stock prices?   There's a few stocks that I've been following where I've noticed afterhours has had much higher trading prices compared to the normal hours.  I'm talking spikes of 4-5% higher in afterhours whereas it's been relatively flat during normal hours.  I've been noticing this pattern for the past week and I'm wondering if this is an indication of anything?  I understand trading after hours has significantly lower volume and thus there can be higher volatility spikes in the prices.  But in this case, I've only seen the price spikes be a lot higher and never lower.  Why would anyone buy shares afterhours at a 5% premium when they could have paid a lot less during normal hours?  And why would this be happening consistently over the last week?

Could this be an indication of the price trending higher?"
191,2024-09-11,39,"Summarized comments from Jensen Huang from today's GS Conference 1) Jensen once again highlights his view that Moore's Law no longer delivers the rate of innovation that's needed and causes computation inflation in Data Center. As such, the rebuilding of $1T data center infrastructure that's currently installed will drive growth over the next 10 years, bringing material performance improvement and cost savings

  
2) ROI: Jensen reiterates that while using a GPU to augment a CPU will drive an increase in cost in nominal terms (roughly 2x), in the case of Spark (a distributed processing system and analytics engine for big data), the net cost benefit could be as large as 10x as the application will be sped up 20x.

  
From a top line generation, he shares that hyperscale customers can generate $5 in rental revenue for every $1 spent on NVDA GPUs, given sustained strength in the demand for accelerated computing.

  
3) With respect to Nvidia's moat, Jensen highlights that the large install base of NVDA GPUs across multiple platforms, ability to augment their hardware with their proprietary software, and ability to build rack-level systems and innovate across various chips creates an insurmountable moat.

  
4) Jensen once again compliments his supply chain partners, highlighting TSMC for being the reason for NVDA's exponential revenue growth in 2H23/2024. That being said, he did note that NVDA has adequate in-house IP to shift manufacturing without material disruption if needed. He also stressed that companies are relentlessly demanding new chips so they can be first, to the point where tensions are rising as they demand their chips now.

283,2024-09-11,33,"Berkshire unloads another chunk of Bank of America as CEO lauds Buffett  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway offloaded another chunk of Bank of America shares, bringing its total sales to more than $7 billion since mid-July and reducing its stake to 11%.

The Omaha-based conglomerate shed a total of 5.8 million BofA shares in separate sales on Friday, Monday and Tuesday for almost $228.7 million at an average selling price of $39.45 per share, according to a new regulatory filing.

The latest action extended Berkshire’s selling streak to 12 consecutive sessions, matching the 12 consecutive sessions from July 17 to Aug. 1.

Berkshire has sold more than 174.7 million shares of the Charlotte-based bank for $7.2 billion, with 858.2 million shares remaining, or 11.1% of shares outstanding. BofA has fallen to the No.3 spot on Berkshire’s list of top holdings, trailing behind Apple and American Express. Before the selling spree, BofA had long been Berkshire’s second biggest holding.

Moynihan on Buffett

Buffett famously bought $5 billion worth of BofA’s preferred stock and warrants in 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He converted those warrants in 2017, making Berkshire the largest shareholder in BofA. The “Oracle of Omaha” then added 300 million more shares to his bet around 2018 and 2019.

BofA CEO Brian Moynihan made a rare comment about Berkshire’s sales Tuesday, saying he has no knowledge of Buffett’s motivation for selling.

“I don’t know what exactly he’s doing, because frankly, we can’t ask him. We wouldn’t ask,” he said during Barclays Global Financial Services Conference, according to a transcript on FactSet. “But on the other hand, the market’s absorbing the stock .... we’re buying a portion of the stock, and so life will go on.”

Shares of BofA have dipped just about 1% since the start of July, and the stock is up 16.7% this year, slightly outperforming the S&P 500.

Moynihan, who has been leading the bank since 2010, praised the 94-year-old’s shrewd investment in his bank in 2011, which helped shore up confidence in the embattled lender struggling with losses tied to subprime mortgages.

“He’s been a great investor for our company, and stabilized our company when we needed at the time,” he said.

To illustrate how lucrative Buffett’s investment has been, Moynihan said if investors were to buy his bank stock the same day Buffett did, they would have been able to capture the low price of $5.50 per share. The stock last traded just under $40 apiece.

“He just had the guts to do it in a big way. And he did it. And it’s been a fabulous return for him. We’re happy that he gets it,” Moynihan said.

315,2024-09-11,82,"Consumer prices rose 0.2% in August with core inflation higher than expected The consumer price index climbed 2.5% year over year in August, according to data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this was in line with the last-minute downward-revised forecasts at 2.5% (previous forecasts at 2.6%).

So, Fed can go ahead with the 50bps rate cut next week? In my opinion, 25bps will be more realistic after this CPI release \~ but let's see.

&#x200B;

**Consumer prices rose 0.2% in August with core inflation higher than expected**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/cpi-inflation-report-august-2024-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/cpi-inflation-report-august-2024-.html)

&#x200B;

*Prices increased as expected in August while the annual inflation rate declined to its lowest level since February 2021, according to a Labor Department report Wednesday that sets the stage for an expected quarter percentage point rate cut from the Federal Reserve in a week.*  
  
*The consumer price index, a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, increased 0.2% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones consensus, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.*  
  
*That put the 12-month inflation rate at 2.5%, down 0.4 percentage point from the July level and compared to the estimate for 2.6%.*  
  
*However, core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.3% for the month, slightly higher than the 0.2% estimate. The 12-month core inflation rate was 3.2%, in line with the forecast.*  
  
*While the numbers showed that inflation slowly continued to moderate, housing-related costs remain an issue. The shelter component of CPI, which has about a one-third weighting in the index, increased 0.5%, accounting for much of the increase in the all-items measure. The shelter index was up 5.2% year over year.*  
  
*Food prices rose just 0.1%, while energy costs slid 0.8%.*  
  
*Elsewhere in the report, used vehicle prices decreased 1%, medical care services declined 0.1% and apparel prices increased 0.3%.*  
  
*Stock market futures moved lower following the report though Treasury yields spiked.*  
  
*In the fed funds futures market, traders priced in an 85% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee will approve a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, interest rate reduction when its meeting concludes Sept. 18, according to the CME Group″s FedWatch measure.*"

# [Stock futures fall as traders brace for August consumer inflation report: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures slipped Wednesday as investors looked toward the August consumer inflation report.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 100 points, or nearly 0.3%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures each dipped about 0.1%.
*****
> The CPI report and Thursday’s producer price index could help determine the size of a widely expected rate cut at the end of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting on Sept. 18. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect the headline CPI to have risen 0.2% from the previous month and 2.6% from a year earlier.
*****
> Fed funds futures trading suggests a 69% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut and a 31% likelihood of a 50-basis-point reduction, according to CME’s FedWatch Tool.
*****
> “I think what we’re going to see next week is a Fed that gives us a 25-basis-point rate cut because to give us a 50-basis-point cut will set off alarm bells and would also be an admission of guilt,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “I don’t think that the Fed keeping us at very restrictive monetary policy levels for a long time creates damage that is irreparable, but I do believe every day that we have rates at these levels the odds of a recession increase,” Hooper added.

0,2024-09-11,15," Trading XBI, small-cap biotech No ingenious post full of DD and mathematical analysis, not smart enough... but I found this. 

Posts recently about 29% yearly gains requiring close observation and intricate trading of 5 different food companies. It received sceptical responses. 

Small cap biotech, that's the companies building new medicines from scratch, one could argue the only industry on earth that truly cannot be disrupted with trillions of dollars, is reasonably well represented by the ETF ticker symbol XBI. 

If, over the last decade, you simply bought XBI at $65 and sold at $90, you'd be at 7x the initial investment (including divs), trouncing... well basically every index I follow, except a squeaker loss to SMH. 

Just sayin'.

934,2024-09-10,843,"GameStop reports fall in revenue, files for 20 million share offering (Reuters) -GameStop said on Tuesday it had filed for an offering of up to 20 million shares, sending its stock down more than 10% in extended trading after the videogame retailer's second-quarter revenue fell as consumers continued to switch to online buying.

The company, which has been at the center of a ""meme stock"" trading frenzy, is struggling with declining sales in its primary business of selling new and used video game discs due to a shift to digital downloads, game streaming, and e-commerce shopping.

GameStop said it intends to use the proceeds from the offering ""for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments in a manner consistent with our investment policy.""

The company is also identifying stores for closure and expects to shut down more outlets than it did in the past few years, it said on Tuesday, in-line with comments made by CEO Ryan Cohen in June.

Cohen warned of intense competition in the gaming console market earlier this year.

Analysts at Wedbush said on Friday GameStop continues to face a near insurmountable barrier to its planned return to growth as streaming services proliferate, while the company shows a total lack of any strategy to enter new categories with growth potential.

Shares of GameStop have seen significant volatility this year after online stock influencer Roaring Kitty returned to X.com following a three-year hiatus, with a cryptic meme that was widely seen as a bullish signal for GameStop.

Roaring Kitty was a key player in the 2021 rally in GameStop and other so-called meme stocks that was fueled by individual investors on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum.

GameStop reported revenue of $798.3 million for the quarter ended Aug. 3 compared with $1.16 billion a year earlier. Two analysts polled by LSEG were expecting revenue of $895.7 million.

Its net income stood at $14.8 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.8 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier. This was helped by a 16% fall in the company's selling and administrative expenses in the quarter.

Shares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday’s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet’s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%. Amazon’s market cap was $22 billion more than Alphabet’s at Monday’s close, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Amazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it’s also focused on “balancing expenditures with revenue growth,” according to BofA analyst Justin Post.

There was also good news from Oracle’s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday. But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS. Oracle already has partnerships with Microsoft’s Azure and Google, but Post notes that the AWS/Oracle deal should be good for both companies. “Oracle & AMZN had been competitive for database customers, so new partnership suggests companies have a lot to gain by working together,” he writes.

Right now investors will just settle for gains.”

0,2024-09-10,62,"Uber Receives 5000+ Assault Reports Each Year And Was Down Until 2023 — Do You Think They Actually Can Make It? [According to stats](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/09/40755761/uber-from-ipo-hype-to-investor-fallout), Uber gets around 5,000 sexual assault reports a year, and they still haven’t really dealt with it properly, even though they heavily advertise as ""a ride you can trust.""

On top of that, Uber only turned a profit last year in their annual operating income, whereas in 2019, they had an $8B loss during their dramatic IPO.

They claim everything's improving now because their CEO has ""revamped"" the company culture — but I’m still not seeing any decline in these assaults or crashes reports. Or is growth more important than human lives? I’ll never ride Uber again — worst passenger experience of my life.

Maybe they should just change CEOs? Or stop expanding so chaotically and focus on the U.S. market instead? Uber ride was the most awful passenger experience, will never order it again"
0,2024-09-10,38,"Why is it so hard to pull the trigger? I'm a relatively new investor. Been doing only for about 3 years. I've been learning a lot and my strategy have changed over that time. 

My current strategy is to invest mostly in index funds, with the occasional stock if it feels clearly undervalued for me. 

About two years ago with the market being down I bought a lot of stocks that have since then recovered, making me some decent profit. It's still a small account but I'm proud of it. 

I really want to close most of those positions and put that money into index funds. When the market is down it's very easy to see what companies are undervalued, but now with the market doing well it's harder for me to see what companies are worth investing in. I have high risk tolerance but also know I won't be able to beat the market long term. 

Anyways... I'm having a hard time closing some of those positions to follow my strategy. My brain knows that's the smarter financial decision but my heart hurts knowing I bought those positions for so cheap and don't want to get rid of them. I've trying to pull the trigger for over a week but can't get myself to do it. Buying is so much easier than selling. How do I get over this feeling? 🤣"

My current portfolio consists of about 75% s&p500 index, 22% total (us) market fund, and then 3% in google. the google was my first trade ever so i just keep it around even if it has a lot of overlap with the other indexes. This being said I know the two funds have overlap with the top 500 stocks but have read that some overlap can be okay in this instance since the total market fund also covers all the other stocks in the market, although i feel like maybe im not diversified enough. I'd say i have about a medium risk tolerance since I only just turned 20 and know i have a lot of potential for growth with the higher risk over the long term. I thought about a international fund but I'm not sure that it would make sense since they don't perform near the us market. I know it diversifies but i also have the worry that if the US is such a power holder in markets that if we go down, then a lot of other markets may also see downturns which wouldn't really offset a downturn in the US markets if it were to occur. I'm not sure if i should maybe take a small position in things that may have more risk/reward in a shorter term and then re-allocate on a certain time based period so i don't get too caught up in a risk allocation. 

What would you guys do in my situation? Do you think my portfolio is fine as is? Is it too much overlapping with the US market? Should I just sit where i'm at because i'm so young and am in a good position?

Again any thoughts, ideas, or opinions would be appreciated. I just like to see what other people do and how they think, then reflect those on my own situation and see if it applies!"
122,2024-09-10,18,"JPMorgan shares drop 7% after bank cuts guidance on interest income and expenses  JPMorgan Chase shares fell 7% Tuesday after the bank’s president told analysts that expectations for net interest income and expenses in 2025 were too optimistic.

While the bank expects to be in the “ballpark” of the 2024 target for NII of about $91.5 billion, the current estimate for 2025 of about $90 billion “is not very reasonable” because the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates, JPMorgan president Daniel Pinto said at financial conference.

“I think that that number will be lower,” Pinto said. He declined to give a specific figure.

The stock move was the New York-based bank’s worst drop since June 2020, according to FactSet. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has been a winner among lenders in recent years, benefiting from better-than-expected growth in NII as the bank gathered more deposits and made more loans than expected. But skittish investors are now concerned about the outlook for a bellwether banking stock.

NII, one of the main ways banks make money, is the difference in the cost of a bank’s deposits and what it earns by lending money or investing it in securities. When interest rates decline, new loans made by the bank and new bonds it purchases will yield less.

Falling rates can help banks in the sense that customers will slow the rotation out of checking accounts and into higher-yielding instruments like CDs or money market funds. But they also make new assets lower yielding, which complicates the picture.

“Clearly, as rates go lower, you have less pressure on repricing of deposits,” Pinto said. “But as you know, we are quite asset sensitive.”

When it comes to expenses, the analyst estimate for next year of roughly $94 billion “is also a bit too optimistic” because of lingering inflation and new investments the firm is making, Pinto said.

“There are a bunch of components that tell us that probably the number on expenses will be a bit higher than what is expected at the moment,” Pinto said.

I'll also get green and red markers to distinguish the good and not so good trading days. The calendar most likely will have a notes section so I can add things to improve, etc.

83,2024-09-10,33,"Boeing delivers 40 jets in August, up 5 from a year ago Sept 10 (Reuters) - Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab said on Tuesday it delivered 40 commercial jets in August, up five from the same month in 2023 when it struggled with a manufacturing defect on its 737 MAX, as the U.S. planemaker eyes higher output under new CEO Kelly Ortberg.

Boeing has pledged to boost production of its strongest selling jet, the MAX, to 38 per month by year's end.

But the planemaker faces obstacles such as a possible strike as early as Friday by more than 32,000 Seattle-area and Portland factory workers who vote on a new deal Sept. 12.

The U.S. planemaker is operating a slower assembly line since a Jan. 5 in-flight blowout, opens new tab of a door plug on a 737 MAX 9 jet that heightened regulatory scrutiny.

Boeing handed over 32 MAX jets to customers last month, including nine deliveries to customers in China, the most since December 2019.

Boeing delivered 43 commercial jets in July, including 31 MAX jets.

Investors closely watch delivery numbers, as airplane makers receive the majority of payment for an aircraft when it is transferred to a customer.

After adjustments to reflect the backlog, Boeing reported adjusted net orders for the month of 24.

That brought Boeing's gross order total so far this year through August 31 to 250. After removing cancellations and conversions, Boeing posted a net total of 207 orders since the start of 2024.

Following further accounting adjustments, Boeing reported adjusted net orders of 122 airplanes so far this year.

Year to date through August 31, Boeing delivered 258 airplanes, including 198 MAX jets.

European rival Airbus (AIR.PA), opens new tab said last week it had delivered 47 aircraft in August, down from 77 in July, to reach 447 so far this year.

*****

# [Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%.
*****
> Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services.
*****
> On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%.
*****
> These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August’s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists’ expectations. The results helped fuel a sell-off that day.
*****
> Traders have their eyes on two key economic reports that will likely be the next catalysts for stocks. The consumer price index report for August is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday.
*****
> September is historically a weak month for equities. Investors remain cautious about seasonality’s effect on stock performance as well as uncertainty around the approaching U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5.
*****
> “We concur with the view that the market is likely to remain choppy at least until the election,” Bank of America equity and quantitative strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. “Macro data have been weakening, especially in manufacturing/goods, which represent 50% of earnings for the S&P 500.”

867,2024-09-10,262,"Apple loses EU court battle over 13 billion euro tax bill in Ireland  Europe’s top court on Tuesday ruled against Apple in the tech giant’s 10-year court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland.

The pronouncement from the European Court of Justice comes hours after Apple unveiled a swathe of new product offerings, looking to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod line-ups.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. The company’s shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.

In 2014, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple’s tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant’s headquarters in the EU.

The Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received “illegal” tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.

Apple and Ireland appealed the Commission’s decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU’s second-highest court anulled the Commission’s 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage.

The Commission in turn appealed the General Court’s decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ.

The case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust.

This was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EU’s crosshairs. Most recently, the Commission hit the iPhone maker hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euro ($1.99 billion) in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

Separately, the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The Commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.

410,2024-09-09,48,"Goldman Sachs to post $400 million hit to third quarter on consumer unwind  Goldman Sachs will post a roughly $400 million pretax hit to third-quarter results as the bank continues to unwind its ill-fated consumer business.

CEO David Solomon said Monday at a conference that by unloading Goldman’s GM Card business, as well as a separate portfolio of loans, the bank would post a hit to revenues when it reports results next month.

It is the latest turbulence related to Solomon’s push into consumer retail. In late 2022, Goldman began to pivot away from its nascent consumer operations, beginning a series of write-downs related to selling chunks of the business. Goldman’s credit card business, in particular its Apple Card, allowed rapid growth in retail lending, but also led to losses and friction with regulators.

Goldman is instead focusing on asset and wealth management to help drive growth. The bank was in talks to sell the GM Card platform to Barclays, The Wall Street Journal reported in April.

Solomon also said Monday that trading revenue for the quarter was headed for a 10% decline because of a tough year-over-year comparison and difficult trading conditions in August for fixed-income markets.

82,2024-09-09,26,"Oracle shares jump on earnings and revenue beat  Oracle shares rose 9% in extended trading on Monday after the database software vendor reported fiscal first-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates.

Here is how the company did compared to LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $1.39 adjusted vs. $1.32 expected

Revenue: $13.31 billion vs. $13.23 billion expected

Oracle’s revenue increased 8% from $12.45 billion a year ago, according to a statement. Net income rose to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $2.42 billion, or 86 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

At its after-hours price of about $153, Oracle is on pace to reach a record on Tuesday. The stock’s highest close to date was $145.03 in July. Prior to the report, Oracle was up about 34% so far this year, compared to the S&P 500′s 15% gain.

For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 8 to 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call. Analysts were expecting growth of close to 9%, according to LSEG. The company sees adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of 1.45 to $1.49. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.47 per share.

The company said its cloud services and license support business generated $10.52 billion in revenue. That was up 10% from a year earlier and higher than the StreetAccount consensus of $10.47 billion.

Oracle’s cloud and on-premises license segment had $870 million in revenue, up 7%, and more than StreetAccount’s $757.6 billion consensus.

Revenue from cloud infrastructure came to $2.2 billion, up 45%. That is an acceleration from the prior quarter, during which revenue went up 42%.

“Demand continued to outstrip supply” of consumption-based cloud infrastructure, Catz said on the call.

During the quarter, Oracle announced the opening of a second cloud region in Saudi Arabia and said its database software will be available through Google’s public cloud.

In a separate statement on Monday, Oracle said it would partner with cloud infrastructure market leader Amazon Web Services to enable its database services on dedicated hardware.

Executives will issue guidance and discuss the results with analysts on a conference call starting at 5 p.m. ET.

>If you buy the top 5 largest food producers by market cap (currently Nestle, Mondelez, Hershey, General Mills, Kraft Heinz) right after ex dividend and sell before Quarterly Earnings. Rinse and repeat every quarter. They statistically yield 29% annually.

My original sim just used those 5 named stocks for the last 4 and 10 years, on the basis that if it can't perform even with ultimate market winners, it has to be a dud. The result was 6% annual returns. 

But some disagreed, arguing that choosing today's winners would make things worse, not better, as it loses the benefit of exploiting short term movers. So I took on the challenge of improving the simulation as a fun project.

And [here are the results](https://postimg.cc/gwkDKNN5) and some extra info showing [how the top 5 shuffle over time](https://postimg.cc/5XmgvZqL). The new approach gives an annualised return of 1%.  

The algorithm: wake up each day and check if there's any earnings dates and if so sell. Then if you have available capital, check the top 5 stocks, and if there's ex div dates, buy.

43,2024-09-09,39,"AI exuberance masks broad weakness in tech sector, say investors >[https://www.ft.com/content/0b14d871-2d19-46f1-9660-5466301e8066](https://www.ft.com/content/0b14d871-2d19-46f1-9660-5466301e8066)

  
**AI exuberance masks broad weakness in tech sector, say investors** 

Many companies unconnected to artificial intelligence boom are yet to recover from post-pandemic downturn 

Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence masks weakness across most of the technology sector, with many companies “still in a recession” following a slowdown that started in 2022, according to investors and analysis of recent financial reports. 

Massive share price gains for large companies that were predicted to be early beneficiaries of AI, such as Nvidia and Microsoft, helped to erase memories of a dreadful 2022, when the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite tumbled by almost a third.  

Beneath the surface, however, many tech businesses that do not focus on AI have struggled to regain momentum. 

“When you look at technology outside of AI, there’s not that much happening,” said Tony Kim, head of technology investing in BlackRock’s fundamental equities division. “Many \[sub\]-sectors are still in a recession. The only thing that has been really growing has been AI.” 

More traditional tech areas such as software, IT consulting and the production of electronic equipment for other sectors such as manufacturing and the auto industry have faced difficulties, including weak demand and the hangover from overexpansion and overstocking of inventories during the coronavirus pandemic. Some have also directly suffered from the growth of AI, as customers with limited budgets redirect investment. 

Dustin Moskovitz, the Facebook co-founder who is now chief executive of Asana, last week summed up the situation for many companies as the business software group scaled back its forecasts for the rest of the year. 

“What we’re seeing in tech is still kind of the unwinding of the over-hiring and overspending that we saw at the beginning of the pandemic,” he told analysts. “And then that all couples with what I think is massive uncertainty in the economic environment. And then, also, just with how AI is going to play out.” 

Recent financial reports show the majority of large tech companies have been growing more slowly than in the past, while many smaller ones are actively shrinking. 

Groups in the S&P 500 IT sub-index increased revenues by an average of 6.9 per cent over the past 12 months, according to Bloomberg data, compared with a five-year average of 10 per cent. About three-quarters of companies grew more slowly than their recent average. 

Earnings per share increased by an average of 16 per cent in the past 12 months, down from 21 per cent over the past five years. 

The weakness is more obvious in small cap indices, where there is no boost from megacap groups. In the Russell 2000, technology was the second-worst performing sector in terms of revenue growth in the second quarter, according to data from LSEG. Revenue fell 6.1 per cent year on year, while profits were down 2.8 per cent. 

“Generative AI is masking a cyclical downturn in a lot of other core sectors,” said Ted Mortonson, a tech strategist at RW Baird. “Everyone is hoping things get better in the next few quarters, though hope is not an investment strategy.” 

Even within subsectors that have been caught up in the AI enthusiasm such as semiconductors, some business lines have been struggling. Brice Hill, chief financial officer at chip equipment supplier Applied Materials, told analysts last month that “we’re seeing particularly strong pull related to AI and data centre computing”, but there were “pockets of weakness in the auto and industrial end-markets”. 

“Everywhere you look on the industrial side it’s similar,” said John Barr, a portfolio manager at Needham Funds who has invested in several semiconductor companies including Applied Materials. “Current growth is not so great, so what we’re looking for are companies that have a stable business and are investing in something new.” Recommended Artificial intelligence Rethinking the AI boom, with Daron Acemoğlu 

Investor exuberance around AI-focused companies has faded since the early summer, leading many commentators to predict a prolonged rotation of investor attention away from Big Tech stocks towards sectors such as financial services and industrials.  

Some tech specialists are hoping for a similar intra-industry rotation from the biggest AI stocks to more unloved corners of the industry. While few companies are predicting the sort of triple-digit growth that Nvidia has reported in recent quarters, there are signs that some of the worst-performing parts of the tech sector are turning a corner. 

“I think we are seeing a stabilisation — things have stopped getting worse in those more macro-sensitive areas, and if rates go down then that will help,” said Tony Wang, portfolio manager for T Rowe Price’s science and technology fund. 

“I feel like the idea that AI is the only thing that is working has been the case for the last two years. I’m not sure it will be the case for the next two.”"
80,2024-09-09,33,"Why ElasticSearch (ESTC) is still overvalued after a 30% drop this month I wanted to bring some qualitative discussion as to why I think Elasticsearch is only at the start of its downfall.

You'll need to know some history behind how Elasticsearch started and why it became so popular in the DevOps world. 

TLDR: They used to be opensource but Amazon basically stole their code and offered their service on AWS with the same name. Elasticsearch got pissed, changed their licensing from open source in 2021 and sued Amazon. Fast forward to today, theyve now settled with Amazon. However, since 2021, AWS has created their own competitor called Opensearch which is basically just a forked version of Elasticsearch with Amazons own contribution to it.... and they've been gaining a ton of market share.

The main reasons why

1. Engineering managers and open source devs that spent time on developing Elasticsearch open source got screwed by Elastic in 2021 and trust eroded

2. Opensearch is a part of the AWS ecosystem and why would a company go out of their way to add another vendor like Elastic if everythings already managed under AWS for them?

This graph shows a snapshot of the adoption of both:  
https://db-engines.com/en/ranking\_trend/system/Elasticsearch%3BOpenSearch%3BSplunk?

As you can see Opensearch is gaining more and more traction where as Elastic seems to be stagnating.

However, anecdotally, I think this is worse than it looks for Elasticsearch. I know for a fact internally teams still refer to Opensearch as Elasticsearch because it is just a fork of it.

  
I think this story will be similar to how Microsoft Teams due to its distribution channels completely swept up market share from Zoom. Similarly, I think this will happen with Opensearch and Elasticsearch."

8,2024-09-09,13,"AMPH & EZPW - Stocks of Interest This is a post mainly looking for a second opinion. There are two stocks piquing my interest right now. 

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH)

EZCORP Inc (EZPW)

Both seem to be companies on the up, growing their earnings and revenues and confident in meeting their guidance for the year. 

Both have grown sales and earnings year over year and quarter over quarter, they are cash generative and have strong balance sheets that more than meet their obligations.

Both have no recent history of significant shareholder dilution or recent stock splits.

EZPW has performed better YTD but AMPH has performed well over the quarter.

EZPW doesn’t raise any major alarms with insider selling, AMPH insider selling is abnormal and seems to point that there could be something fishy happening, both have only had insider selling this year and no buying.

Neither are currently buying back shares but EZPW has hinted at a potential buyback in the near future.

What’s interesting about these two is that they both currently have short interest of float above 10% with short ratios over 10. 

There seems to be a significant negative sentiment for these two companies and I cannot figure out why. Their reports are strong and neither is facing any serious issues or litigation, in fact they both appear to be great value.

I smell a potential squeeze with both of these companies, the short interest seems unwarranted, the only potential red flag I can see are the insider sales at AMPH.

Now I’m still a student at all of this so I’m asking if someone smarter than me might be able to uncover why there is such a negative sentiment for these companies. 

Is it something macroeconomic? By their recent earnings calls I can’t see any major headwinds highlighted for either business.

I am grateful if you’ve read this far.
These seem to me like potential value opportunities, I would love to see what people can uncover that I might have missed and where I can improve my analysis."

0,2024-09-08,35,"The AAPL Monday Morning arbitrage trade (codename 7senshino's arbitrage) Update:  a user reminded me it's not an arbitrage, I agree with him. However I'm not able to update the post title, so I'm putting this update on the front here 

I'm sharing this old idea I had more than a decade ago. I bought AAPL around 2012. Then for several years, I would look daily at it's stock price. One day i noticed that if I bought AAPL at 9am ET on Monday morning then sell at 9.30am ET, I could possibly make a profit, at least on days where the market would not be doom and gloomy.
Doing it daily and compounding the profits, I'd end up possibly rich, at least based on a quick calculation I did in either 2014 or 2015  with a subset of data ranging forabout a quarter length...

That's it, easy right, little risk, hence a possible arbitrage:
Buy AAPL at 9 on Monday, sell it at 9.30.

But I never executed the idea as I didn't want to get into the active trading thing.
Fast forward now in 2024, I'm wondering if it  was a great idea?
I don't have access to my Bloomberg anymore and don't have time to run numbers. Maybe it's an old well known idea among traders and I'm not the first one who thought about it. 
Maybe it's still a valid trade, maybe there are other stocks who would enjoy the Monday morning effect or kick.
I have no idea.
But I wanted to share it here to all the experts to get some insights.
Feel free to use it if you can make a buck out of it. If you become rich and reach the moon, don't forget me :).
Cheers.

Been investing for a few years now, not nearly enough of an expert but know my way around.

I have a few positions (Tesla, Spotify, etc) that I have gains of about 20-30% on. I’ve been thinking about cashing them out and putting them in VOO to lock them in while giving them the opportunity to grow as well.

Does this make sense? I still would invest regularly into these individual stocks as I pretty much do recurring buys weekly but is this a good way to lock in gains? Any other recommendations?"

My goal is long-term investing for the next 30 years or so. VOO gives me about the same rate of return but at an expense ratio of 0.03%. To keep numbers simple, assuming I have exactly $100k invested with 10% annual rate of return and I never invest another cent. In 30 years I would have \~$32k more if I had invested in VOO instead of VGT. I do however intend to continue contributing funds into this account, so the difference in earnings between VGT and VOO would only increase from there.

I believe it is worth it to sell VGT to purchase VOO. But now, how can I optimally reduce capital gains tax in selling and purchasing a different ETF? I have held VGT for over 1 year. This will be my first time selling a large amount of ETFs (or any stocks for that matter), and I'd also like any advice on other factors to consider during this sell. I know selling all at once then buying all at once is likely not the best strategy...Do  people set up increments of automatic buy/sells at specific prices? "

A cool idea that prompted me to get set up with proper simulation capabilities. u/LocomotionLover let me know if you see any errors. This new post needed for table markdown.

My simulation (python and EODHD) shows that over the last 10 years or 4 years, returns are 6% per year with 58% time in the market, so effective rate 10%. Not as far off S&P500 than I expected, though a long way off the 29% promised.

# ImmunityBio Presents Positive Long-Term Overall Survival Data in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients and Announces Registrational Intent Phase 3 Trials with ANKTIVA® and Checkpoint Immunotherapy at World Conference on Lung Cancer

* Phase 2 data presented at the World Conference on Lung Cancer showing a prolonged median overall survival of over 14 months in 2^(nd) and 3^(rd) line NSCLC cancer patients who progressed on checkpoint inhibitors such as KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) and OPDIVO (nivolumab)
* ANKTIVA plus KEYTRUDA or OPDIVO rescued T cell activity in these patients who progressed on the same checkpoint inhibitor with overall survival of 57% at 12 months
* Long-term survival was independent of PDL1 tumor status and independent of 2^(nd) or 3^(rd) line of therapy
* The data continues to validate the mechanism of action of ANKTIVA in activating NK, CD8 killer, and Memory T cells resulting in prolonged overall survival in patients with advanced cancers
* Data supports global launch of Phase 3 randomized control of ResQ trials of ANKTIVA plus KEYTRUDA or OPDIVO in 1^(st) and 2^(nd) line NSCLC (ResQ301 and ResQ302) versus standard of care

Bio Investments can be extremely risky.  Once in a while we see a unique company pursuing unique science with massive potential.

* **Immunity Bio's Anktiva a new blockbuster**
   * ANKTIVA, developed by ImmunityBio, has received FDA approval for use in combination with BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) to treat BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). This drug leverages the immune system, particularly by stimulating natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, to fight cancer, offering a promising new treatment option for patients who previously faced invasive surgery
   * ANKTIVA is also being investigated for multiple other conditions, including various solid tumors, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and HIV
* **Immunity Bio Finances at a glance**
   * ImmunityBio is experiencing deficit and cash-flow challenges, according to the filing. As of June 30, the company had an accumulated deficit of $3.2 billion. It also had negative cash flows of $207.3 million during the six months ended June 30.
   * The company also said in the filing that it believes there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue without additional funding. However, it went on to note that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities; sales of approved product; capital to be raised through equity offerings; and potential ability to borrow from affiliated entities will fund operations through at least 12 months.
* **Understanding the CEO**
   * Soon-Shiong's net worth is **$6.2 billion** as of 2024. He has been called the richest man in Los Angeles and one of the wealthiest doctors in the world.
   * Soon-Shiong purchased Fujisawa, which sold injectable generic drugs, in 1998. He used its revenues to develop Abraxane, which took an existing chemotherapy drug, Taxol, and wrapped it in protein that made it easier to deliver to tumors. He was able to quickly move it through the regulatory process and made his fortune with this medicine
      * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick\_Soon-Shiong#References](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Soon-Shiong#References)
* **ImmunityBio  Strategic partnership in India.**
   * Collaboration will result in BCG manufacture at large scale for use in combination with ANKTIVA®, ImmunityBio’s recently approved treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)
   * Serum Institute of India (SII) will manufacture both standard BCG (“sBCG”) and next-generation recombinant BCG (“iBCG”), creating a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues
* **Next indication approval**
   * ImmunityBio Announces Positive Overall Survival Results of Anktiva Combined With Checkpoint Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer; Meeting Scheduled with FDA to Discuss Registration Path for ANKTIVA in Lung Cancer
      * QUILT 3.055 trial completed and shows median overall survival almost double that of standard of care chemotherapy in 2^(nd)– and 3^(rd)-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose cancer did not respond to checkpoint inhibitors with or without chemotherapy.
      * Positive results seen in both PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive participants with NSCLC
      * Data reaffirms the mechanism of action of ANKTIVA as an immune cell enhancer that activates natural killer (NK) cells and memory T cells to rescue checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab) failures across multiple tumor types
* **Presentation TODAY (08/09/2024)**
   * **Results**: The median OS (n=86) was 14.1 months (95% CI 11.7, 17.4) with 24 ongoing survival to date. In 3^(rd) line+ve (n=25) median OS was 14.8 months (95% CI 9.1, 26.7). OS for PDL1+ve (>1%) (N=53) was 13.8 months (95% CI 10.2, 17.4) versus PDL1-ve (N=33) blah blah blah......... [https://cattendee.abstractsonline.com/meeting/20598/Session/142Conclusions:](https://cattendee.abstractsonline.com/meeting/20598/Session/142Conclusions:) Anktiva plus CPI therapy in 2nd line or greater NSCLC demonstrated long-term median OS, independent of PDL1 status, and independent of prior lines of therapy in patients with acquired resistance to CPI. These findings support the novel mechanism of action of Anktiva to rescue CPI activity through the activation of NK and T cells, driving long-term memory, with median OS ongoing survival of 33% and 30% at 18 and 21 months respectively, exceeding the standard of care.
* **Conclusion (or my opinion)**
   * IBRX has in Dr. Soon  a business man that knows how to invest and get returns. It is likely IBRX will have all rights to USA/North America - but  will partner with Big Pharma (J&J, Astra or so) for EMEA region.  Looking at his previous businesses,  I assume he will do the same once again.  Sell/partner at the right moment.  Estimated sales is 900 million p/a by 2028.  That is for 1 indication only.
   * A partnership will likely alter the balance sheet of IBRX, see an upfront payment and milestone payments too.
      * Part of my thesis is UK approval.   While Europe approvals take time, UK approval is easier. due to the International Reliance Procedure \[7\]. If the MHRA decides to take this road for approving Anktiva, then (at least theoretically) a UK approval could be a fact within 2024............ **And guess where the plane of the Dr. has been this month?  Yes, Heathrow.**"
28,2024-09-08,5,"$PBT - Oil, Pirates, and a potential special dividend A royalty trust is a financial entity that distributes sales income to shareholders usually made through ownership rights to mineral deposits, wells, or reservoirs typically in the energy sector of oil and gas. Permian Basin Royalty Trust (PBT), is one such trust whose bulk of assets are located in the Permian Basin. With a 5-7% yearly cash yield distribution paid monthly to shareholders, it has potentially bottomed with a setup to reach 2023 highs upon resolution.

Due to changes made to the operator and trustee since 2020, PBT has come under a third party Joint Venture audit which are common to ensure operations are being ran prudently by a third party. New operator, Blackbeard Operating, LLC decided to halt communications with the trustee after being confronted with +$15M in overcharges for the 2020-2022 audit and another $20-25M according to the trustee pending audit of 2023-2024, resulting in a federal legal dispute in late Dec. 2023. With pending resolutions, if operator spending were to decrease by limiting and requiring correct charges to the trust, based on the 5-7% gives a monthly distribution range of $0.18-0.20 moving forward. A potential special dividend of +$3/share could be recouped for missing production reported to the trust and CAPEX issues.

More information on the dispute and other issues can be found on the trustee website: [https://pbt-permian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024.05.08-FILED-Plaintiffs-Original-Petition-PBRT-in-State-Court-1.pdf](https://pbt-permian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024.05.08-FILED-Plaintiffs-Original-Petition-PBRT-in-State-Court-1.pdf)

It's also not like Nvidia just released CUDA and graphic cards capable of doing AI work. Its also not like Machine Learning is new.

* Machine Learning has been used in scientific research for a long time now (atleast in Physics/Astronomy).
* Look at Cyberpunk video game. It released in 2020 and started development in 2016. It used AI to lip-sync character conversations into 10 languages. This was back in 2016-2020.
* GPT-1,2,3 was released in 2018/19/20. Here's a part from wiki about LLM - ""Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use."".

Looking at that Sam Altman/Microsoft etc didn't think they should pour trillions into it or just buy all Nvidia chips? Nvidia earnings actually went down in 2019 lol.

All these companies knew about it years before. So what changed? Is it just that ChatGPT became public and people realised what it could do? or is there a more technical reason that justifies this?

I looked at dot-com bubble. That was spurred by creation of public Web which became accessible in 1993 - so naturally only after 1993 could people even imagine websites etc and then there were new startups blah blah. Something, that couldn't have been anticipated, actually changed to cause the hype and new funding.

But this time around it seems to me like nothing fundamentally changed. Did companies/investors just overlook use of AI until 2022? Then looking at ChatGPT suddenly realised they were missing out on a trillion dollar industry that will revolutionize human lives? I am really confused about what happened. So please ELI5.

Edit - I will summarize what people are saying in comments and share this tweet someone commented- [https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1828407633541296603](https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1828407633541296603)

Most important part is about scaling laws and emergent properties. Essentially - AI is showing unexpectedly ""intelligent"" properties at higher compute powers (emergent properties) and these companies now believe that this will scale at even higher compute powers. No one know what will happen. It might happen that the emergent properties was a one time thing and AI may never get more intelligent or it will continue and we get a ""Digital God"" (according to the tweet).

So something did change in last couple of years, and the reason no one invested before was because no one saw it coming and it was an emergent property."

369,2024-09-06,219,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren writes a letter backing the DOJ investigation into Nvidia antitrust allegations https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-backs-justice-department-nvidia-antitrust-investigation-2024-9

September 5 2024

Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter.

Competition is key to a thriving U.S. economy and faster economic growth. This is particularly true in the semiconductor market, which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech breakthroughs --- the reason Congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the CHIPS and Science Act.

This is why I welcome the reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world's largest companies. While this growth has been primarily driven by the recent AI boom, it has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. I am pleased that the DOJ has joined authorities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union, in investigating Nvidia's conduct.

Until recently, Nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips, but as a ""prime beneficiary of the Al frenzy,"" it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250% between November 2021 and May 2024. The money involved is vast, and Big Tech is spending most of it: Microsoft and Meta spent a combined $9 billion on Nvidia's chips last year alone. Amazon purchased as many as 50,000 chips in 2023. And Google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into AI this year much of it on Nvidia's products and services.

As a result of this spending, Nvidia now controls an estimated 90% of the market for high-end AI chips and 98% of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units (GPUS) market. Its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every AI milestone, including the development and deployment of OpenAl's ChatGPT-4 and other models. Market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay, with some experts theorizing that Nvidia has been making a 1000% profit through the retail price of some of its chips. This has effectively made Nvidia the gatekeeper for the world's AI future. 

But in carrying out this responsibility, Nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. The company locks customers in by bundling products, software, and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in France-resulting in Nvidia's own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. In a move that was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission, Nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring Arm Limited, the developer of essential chip architecture. If the deal had gone through, experts say Nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. As Nvidia cements its dominance, venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. Indeed, the number of U.S. venture funding deals for Al chips fell approximately 80% between 2022 and 2023.

The insatiable hunger of gargantuan Big Tech companies for Nvidia chips, along with the company's opaque and preferential allocation of them, are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic AI researchers out of the field. Allowing a single company so much influence over AI research, development, and monetization poses dire economic risks. Competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. It creates jobs and generates tax revenue. It reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. It reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers.

Without the intervention of U.S. regulators, the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. They will only grow bleaker as Nvidia approaches 100% ownership of the market, and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional Big Tech players to shape the contours of AI regulation and lock in its advantage. I thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into Nvidia.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Warren 
United States Senator

> The Taiwanese chipmaker’s yield rate in trial production at its first advanced US plant is similar to comparable facilities in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan, according to a person familiar with the company, who asked not to be identified discussing private corporate matters. TSMC had said it started engineering wafer production in April with advanced 4-nanometer process technology.

> Yield rate, or how many usable chips a company can produce during a single manufacturing process, is a key factor that impacts profitability. While TSMC doesn’t disclose its yield rate, investors are counting on the company’s ability to maintain steady margins. The company has said it can maintain gross margin rates at 53% or higher in the long run, and has kept its net profit steady at above 36% over the past four years.

> TSMC said in an email that its Arizona project is “proceeding as planned with good progression,” without commenting on the yield.

> The go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. originally planned to have its first Arizona plant start full production in 2024, but pushed back the target to 2025 due to a lack of skilled workers. The delay fueled concerns that the company might not be able to make chips in the US as efficiently as in Taiwan.

> The US plans to award TSMC $6.6 billion in grants and as much as $5 billion in loans to support the chipmaker’s $65 billion in investments at three plants in Arizona.

I thought yahoo finance had a great options chain ...all the contract price changes are listed in percent (as well as dollar amount) but there seems to be a huge delay in the morning so i am guessing the data is delayed by at least 15minutes.... right?

Other websites offer option chain lists data but their data is delayed by 15 minutes and some dont list contract price changes in percentage but rather just give it dollar amount...and some websites require you to pay to access   
  
Some websites require you to register which is something i dont mind doing unless they ask for my social security number (SIN) and phone number ... cause you know its all going to get leaked / hacked one day :-(

so are there any websites that will just give the options chain data, with percent change, without delay and free of charge?"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

When HIMS was $23 it had much higher beta, it's price has catered to $14 now. Normally, there's no causation with beta is my understanding so it's not useful individually. However, in this case scenario could a high beta stock coming back down to market level be considered a good buy signal?"

118,2024-09-06,65,"Broadcom tests with Intel did not suffer a setback. Misleading headline? Recently, an article from Reuters came out to conclude that ""Broadcom's tests with Intel chips was a setback"" and suggested that ""Broadcom could walk away from Intel deal.""  Article even suggested that company  concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Link: [Exclusive: Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-manufacturing-business-suffers-setback-broadcom-tests-disappoint-sources-2024-09-04/)

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is **""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""**

Intel goes on to say that their 18A chips is healthy and powering well.

Then the article goes on to trash Intel's recent downturn. Finally the piece ends with:

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

102,2024-09-06,15,"Salesforce to acquire startup Own for $1.9 billion in cash  Salesforce announced Thursday that it would pay $1.9 billion in cash for Own Co., a startup specializing in tools for backing up data in cloud-based applications. Salesforce intends to close the deal in the quarter ending in January 2025 if regulators give it their blessing, according to a statement.

The startup, formerly known as OwnBackup, was valued at $3.35 billion in a 2021 funding round. Salesforce Ventures, the cloud software company’s venture arm, invested in that round and earlier ones.

The proposed deal would mark the return of sizable deals for Salesforce, less than two years after co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said the board was eliminating a committee on mergers and acquisitions.

Benioff’s pronouncement came after activist investors bought stakes in Salesforce and raised questions about profitability after the company had splurged on expensive assets, including MuleSoft and Slack, without delivering major growth in return.

The decline in value for Own reflects a more sluggish backdrop for software companies.

In late 2021, investors became less interested in cloud software, which had seen a surge in adoption in 2020 thanks to remote-work policies instituted after Covid. Central banks raised rates to ward off inflation, prompting money-losing cloud companies to focus more on profitability. Enterprises aiming to slim down information-technology budgets consolidated their purchases, burdening single-product companies, including startups and publicly traded companies.

Anaplan, Avalara, Coupa, Everbridge, Qualtrics, Sumo Logic and Zendesk all went private.

Own, which had specialized in helping Salesforce clients, sought to diversify. In its 2021 funding announcement, it touted its intent to work with Microsoft’s Dynamics enterprise software that competes with Salesforce’s core applications. Support for ServiceNow followed.

Salesforce in recent weeks has also revealed plans to buy smaller startups PredictSpring and Tenyx.

Salesforce said the Own acquisition wouldn’t impact Salesforce’s shareholder return initiatives, and said the deal would be accretive to free cash flow starting in the second year after the deal closes.

In April, data-management software maker Informatica said it was not in talks to be acquired after media outlets reported Salesforce was interested in buying the company for around $10 billion.

“We’re going to be looking at products organically, but, yes, we will continue to look at products inorganically,” Benioff told analysts on Salesforce’s May earnings call. “But as we’ve committed to you, if we’re looking at a large-scale acquisition, we’re going to make sure that it is not dilutive to our customers, that it’s accretive, that it has the right metrics.”

349,2024-09-06,66,"Broadcom says it will sell $12 billion in AI parts and custom chips this year Broadcom reported fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings.

Broadcom shares fell 7% in extended trading after guidance was in-line with expectations.

Here is how the chipmaking conglomerate did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter that ended Aug. 4:

Earnings per share: $1.24 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected

Revenue: $13.07 billion vs. $12.97 billion expected

Broadcom projects current-quarter revenue of $14 billion, versus $1.36 per share on $14.04 billion expected.

Broadcom reported a net loss of $1.88 billion, or a loss of 40 cents per share, versus net income in the year-ago quarter of $6.12 billion, or $1.24 per share.

The company said the net loss for the third quarter includes a one-time tax provision of $4.5 billion related to trading intellectual property rights from one company segment to another based in the U.S. as part of supply chain management.

Broadcom stock is up 75% in the past year as investors have come to appreciate that the company produces several parts that are required for big data centers or can be used to create infrastructure for artificial intelligence. For example, Broadcom works on Google’s TPU chip, which Apple used to train some of its AI features.

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that the company expects to record $12 billion in sales from AI parts and custom chips in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of $11 billion.

“Broadcom’s third quarter results reflect continued strength in our AI semiconductor solutions and VMware,” Tan said in a statement. The company reported $7.27 billion in semiconductor sales during the quarter, up 5% annually. It is still larger than Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, which reported $5.8 billion in sales, much of which is from the company’s VMware acquisition.

46,2024-09-05,8,"Nio Reports Q2 Earnings: Revenue Nearly Doubles, Gross Margin Hits 9.7% Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio published on Thursday its second quarter earnings results posting a revenue increase of 98.9 per cent year over year mainly attributed to the 144 per cent surge in vehicle deliveries.

The company reported a vehicle margin of 12.2 per cent in the second quarter, nearly doubling from the 6.2 per cent reported a year ago and up sequentially from the 9.2 per cent reported in the first three months of the year.

137,2024-09-05,27,"Snap sued by New Mexico AG over 'sextortion' of kids by predators  The New Mexico attorney general filed a lawsuit against Snap, alleging that its social media app Snapchat’s design and algorithmic recommendations “openly foster and promote illicit sexual material involving children and facilitate sextortion and the trafficking of children, drugs, and guns.”

The suit calls Snapchat “a breeding ground for predators to collect sexually explicit images of children and to find, groom and extort them.”

New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez, who has a pending lawsuit against Facebook owner Meta for allegedly enabling the sexual exploitation of children, in a statement said, “Snap has misled users into believing that photos and videos sent on their platform will disappear, but predators can permanently capture this content and they have created a virtual yearbook of child sexual images that are traded, sold, and stored indefinitely.

“Through our litigation against Meta and Snap, the New Mexico Department of Justice will continue to hold these platforms accountable for prioritizing profits over children’s safety,” Torrez said.

CNBC has requested comment from Snap about Torrez’s lawsuit, which was filed in the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe County.

The suit alleges that Snap “repeatedly made statements to the public regarding the safety and design of its platforms that it knew were untrue,” or that were contradicted by the company’s own internal findings.

“Snap was specifically aware, but failed to warn children and parents, of ‘rampant’ and ‘massive’ sextortion on its platform — a problem so grave that it drives children facing merciless and relented blackmail demands or disclosure of intimate images to their families and friends to suicide,” the suit says.

New Mexico’s Department of Justice, which Torrez leads, in recent months conducted an investigation that found that there was a “vast network of dark web sites dedicated to sharing stolen, non-consensual sexual images from Snap” and that there were more than 10,000 records related to SNAP and child sexual abuse material “in the last year alone,” the department said.

The suit alleges violations of New Mexico’s unfair trade practices law.

45,2024-09-05,6,"Volvo Cars cuts margin and revenue aims after ditching electric vehicle target Volvo Cars on Thursday scaled back its margin and revenue targets, after announcing it was no longer targeting 100% all-electric vehicle sales by 2030.

The Swedish automaker, which is majority-owned by China’s Geely Holding, said it is now targeting a 2026 EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin goal of 7-8%, down from “above 8%,” due to “increased complexity especially in relation to global trade and tariffs.”

It added that it was now seeking to “continue outgrowing the premium car market until 2026,” rather than sticking to its previously announced revenue target of between 500 billion Swedish kronor ($48.6 billion) and 600 billion kronor.

Ever-shifting international trade disputes and tariffs have become a major headache for automakers as they navigate geopolitics between the European Union, China and the U.S., while also seeking a competitive edge in a market dominated by the EV transition.

Volvo Cars shares were 3.2% higher in early afternoon deals following a 10% decline so far this week.

The firm is holding its Capital Markets Day in Gothenburg, Sweden where it is discussing its product plans for the coming years with a firm focus on shifting to electric and plug-in hybrid models. Volvo Cars has five fully-electric models on the market, along with five in development.

However, on Wednesday it revealed that it would no longer target 100% electric vehicle sales by 2030 — which it defines as “cars with a cord” — instead looking for a 90-100% range, allowing mild hybrid models to continue to be sold. Mild hybrids have internal combustion engines which utilize some electric assistance.

Volvo cited consumer demand, a slower-than-expected rollout of charging infrastructure, a withdrawal of government incentives in some markets and uncertainty from fresh tariffs on EVs in various markets as reasons for the change.

It said it remains committed to fully electric sales in the longer term “when the market conditions are suitable.”

Numerous automakers have reported challenges related to the electric vehicle transition, particularly from underwhelming demand. Many consumers, meanwhile, continue to complain of insufficient charging infrastructure and cite concerns about range.

Volvo Cars also announced Thursday that it was extending its partnership with U.S. chip giant Nvidia as it develops features including advanced driving assistance and autonomous driving. It also said it would switch to a “single technology stack” as it looks to bring down the costs of EV manufacturing.

Figures released by Volvo Cars on Thursday showed its global sales rose 3% year-on-year in August, driven by 32% growth in Europe, as China sales tumbled 23%.

4,2024-09-05,73,"Walgreens is a easy buyout target And I think Amazon should buy them.

Drug stores have evolved from the time they first popped up and people love shopping there because its, convenient.  

Pros

-Amazon is an online retailer with no real retail space yet. Their first stores weren't done right. 

-Amazon already has an online medical clinic(One Medical) and pharmacy business that could be easily integrated together.

-Amazon with their analytics could easily stock each store and location with the right products from their online inventory making each store more profitable.

-Amazon has high shipping/delivery costs and growing each year. people are starting to have a package theft issue. Your local store can easily become a pick up spot of your packages, safely. Whole foods stores are very limited for pick up, same with pick up lockers. 

-Would also be a good returns spot, no need for Kohls or UPS eating into costs. 

-Could have bigger stores in some locations for a bigger variety of products and services. Kroger's has some grocery stores and some marketplace stores. Amazon is essentially a giant warehouse that has to ship everything to your doorstep. 

-Amazon is launching a Shein and Temu competitor, stores could easily offer cheaper products in the right neighborhoods. What usually deters people from making a purchase is the shipping cost, nobody wants to order $35 of stuff just to avoid the shipping fee, plus tax.  



-Walgreens 

	-more than 8,700 retail locations across the U.S.

	-annual revenue for 2023 was $1451B, Amzn makes this in a quarter

	  (1) Pharmacy:	         $87B 60%

	  (2) Retail:	         $37B 26%

	  (3) Wholesale & Others:$20B 14%

	-Walgreens owns Alliance Boots, a retail pharmacy/beauty store across the UK: https://www.boots-uk.com/about-boots-uk/our-purpose-and-values/our-stores/ 

	-Boots owns The No7 Beauty Company:  https://www.no7company.com/

	-Most importantly Walgreens has ALOT if not most of their stores in busy high traffic areas making their locations valuable and offers convenience shopping. 

	

Cons

-Walgreens has $32B in debt

-Might need regulatory approval but Whole Foods got approved so this shouldn't be much of a problem 

-Will likely need to close some unprofitable stores and sell the land or transform them into something else



This deal makes more sense than Amazon buying Whole Foods, and they already have this retail experience. If Amazon doesn't make an offer i think a private equity company will take it private and turn the business around. 



I like the stock. Amazons acquisition would revitalize the brand and bring new excitement if done right.  Bought some shares because they are cheap and this is way over sold.

515,2024-09-05,218,"How has Visa and Mastercard been able to operate for so long without being disrupted? I was reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f9jvjg/visa_debuts_a_new_product_designed_to_make_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) post about how Visa is implementing a way for bank-to-business payments to go through them instead of the normal process and it got me thinking: How the fuck has Visa been able to perpetrate this system for so long without big businesses or congress wiping their shit out? 

Think about it, visa gets to collect money from every sale, not issue their cards, and they don't have to put any of their own credit on the line whenever they do it. Meanwhile, ACH is regulated to shit by the fed and a bunch of banks, but somehow Visa and Mastercard get to slip by and have profit margins of 50%. 

You'd think with the rise of the internet their influence would've been significantly reduced by competitors, but it appears to only get stronger by the year.  "

# [Stock futures are flat after two straight down days for S&P 500, Nasdaq: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were flat Thursday as Wall Street looks to regain momentum after a rocky start to September. Key labor market data is also on deck this week.
*****
> Futures for the S&P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq 100 futures hovered near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 50 points.
*****
> The moves come after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each closed lower for the second straight session, dipping 0.16% and 0.30%, respectively. The Dow squeezed out a gain of 38 points, or 0.09%, on Wednesday.
*****
> All three averages are down for the week, with key employment reports looming. On Thursday morning, investors will get to sift through weekly jobless claims data, while the August nonfarm payrolls report is due out Friday.
*****
> The market has appeared to be sensitive to potential growth scares in recent weeks, including Tuesday’s sell-off on the heels of weak manufacturing data. That could put increased importance on the jobless claims data, BMO Wealth Management chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma said on “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “That’s more of a forward-looking indicator. As long as those stay low — people have jobs, people remain confident in the ability to find jobs or comfortable in the jobs that they have — we think that they will continue to spend. So as long as those numbers stay low, if we get some blips in the overall monthly jobs report that shows weakness on the edges, we’re not quite as concerned,” Ma said.
*****
> The employment data could play a key role in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later this month. Ma said he still believes the U.S. economy is on track for a “soft landing” and that the market rally should eventually broaden out. However, he added that there is likely to be continued market turbulence in the near term.
*****
> “We believe in it, we just think it’s going to be on pause for a few months because this high degree of uncertainty we have right now. There’s just too much that needs to resolved over the coming months. … It’s just very hard for the broadening-of-the-market theme to really gather momentum,” Ma said.

0,2024-09-05,156,"What is the growth stock endgame? The question is the title. I don't understand what a growth stock is trying to achieve, let alone the incentive for purchasing one in the first place. I can understand a dividend stock in that one is paid a portion of the company's earnings and the price of the stock reflects the certainty and amount of this dividend.

In the past, I believe the idea was to buy a company stock low, hope for a rise, and then hope some larger company would either offer cash buyouts or equity in their own company which paid dividends. So there was a sort of endgame mindset that the growth stock eventually delivered and the market cap of the company at merger time was the price paid to the shareholders. Or a company which was originally a growth stock begins to implement dividends. But are people buying NVIDIA at 50x P/E because they expect higher dividends? It's currently like $0.04/stock per year, so without the growth to entice me to buy the stock, I'm getting returns well below my checking account interest rate.

It appears that people are treating stock like Bitcoin, which is to say theyve invested in a hyped asset purely for the joy of a speculative activity."
96,2024-09-05,47,"Visa debuts a new product designed to make it safer to pay directly from your bank account  Visa said it plans to launch a dedicated service for bank transfers, skipping credit cards and the traditional direct debit process.

Visa, which alongside Mastercard is one of the world’s largest card networks, said Thursday it plans to launch a dedicated service for account-to-account (A2A) payments in Europe next year.

Users will be able set up direct debits — transactions that take funds directly from your bank account — on merchants’ e-commerce stores with just a few clicks.

Visa said consumers will be able to monitor these payments more easily and raise any issues by clicking a button in their banking app, giving them a similar level of protection to when they use their cards.

The service should help people deal with problems like unauthorized auto-renewals of subscriptions, by making it easier for people to reverse direct debit transactions and get their money back, Visa said. It won’t initially apply its A2A service to things like TV streaming services, gym memberships and food boxes, Visa added, but this is planned for the future.

The product will initially launch in the U.K. in early 2025, with subsequent releases in the Nordic region and elsewhere in Europe later in 2025. 

Direct debit headaches

The problem currently is that when a consumer sets up a payment for things like utility bills or childcare, they need to fill in a direct debit form.

But this offers consumers little control, as they have to share their bank details and personal information, which isn’t secure, and have limited control over the payment amount.

Static direct debits, for example, require advance notice of any changes to the amount taken, meaning you have to either cancel the direct debit and set up a new one or carry out a one-off transfer.

With Visa A2A, consumers will be able to set up variable recurring payments (VRP), a new type of payment that allows people to make and manage recurring payments of varying amounts.

“We want to bring pay-by-bank methods into the 21st century and give consumers choice, peace of mind and a digital experience they know and love,” Mandy Lamb, Visa’s managing director for the U.K. and Ireland, said in a statement Thursday.

“That’s why we are collaborating with UK banks and open banking players, bringing our technology and years of experience in the payments card market to create an open system for A2A payments to thrive.”

Visa’s A2A product relies on a technology called open banking, which requires lenders to provide third-party fintechs with access to consumer banking data.

Open banking has gained popularity over the years, especially in Europe, thanks to regulatory reforms to the banking system.

The technology has enabled new payment services that can link directly to consumers’ bank accounts and authorize payments on their behalf — provided they’ve got permission.

In 2021, Visa acquired Tink, an open banking service, for 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion). The deal came on the heels of an abandoned bid from Visa to buy competing open banking firm Plaid.

Visa’s buyout of Tink was viewed as a way for it to get ahead of the threat from emerging fintechs building products that allow consumers — and merchants — to avoid paying its card transaction fees.

Merchants have long bemoaned Visa and Mastercard’s credit and debit card fees, accusing the companies of inflating so-called interchange fees and barring them from directing people to cheaper alternatives.

In March, the two companies reached a historic $30 billion settlement to reduce their interchange fees — which are taken out of a merchant’s bank account when a shopper uses their card to pay for something.

Visa didn’t share details on how it would monetize its A2A service. By giving merchants the option to bypass cards for payments, there’s a risk that Visa could potentially cannibalize its own card business.

For its part, Visa told CNBC it is and always has been focused on enabling the best ways for people to pay and get paid, whether that’s through a card or non-card transaction.

167,2024-09-05,44,"Verizon to acquire Frontier Communications in $20 billion deal to boost fiber network  Verizon said on Thursday it would buy Frontier Communications in an all-cash deal valued at $20 billion, as the U.S. wireless carrier looks to boost its fiber network.

Shares of Frontier Communications fell more than 9% in premarket trading. Verizon climbed about 1%.

Verizon has offered $38.50 per Frontier share held, a premium of 37.3% to Frontier’s closing price on Sept. 3, before reports of a potential acquisition emerged.

The acquisition, which is expected to close in about 18 months, will help Verizon better compete against AT&T and others by enabling it to deliver premium broadband services to existing as well as new customers.

Frontier has 2.2 million fiber subscribers across 25 states, which will combine with Verizon’s about 7.4 million Fios connections in nine states and Washington, D.C.

Verizon’s fiber network is largely in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, while Frontier’s coverage spans multiple states in the Midwest, Texas, California and others.

“The acquisition of Frontier is a strategic fit. It will build on Verizon’s two decades of leadership ... and is an opportunity to become more competitive in more markets throughout the United States,” Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said in a statement.

The deal is projected to generate at least $500 million in annual run-rate cost synergies, and will add to Verizon’s revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization growth upon closing.

670,2024-09-04,147,"Nvidia says it didn’t receive antitrust subpoena from DOJ 

Nvidia on Wednesday denied reports it received a subpoena from the Department of Justice over antitrust concerns.

“We have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,” an Nvidia representative told CNBC. “Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Nvidia had received a subpoena, causing the stock to [slip in after-hours trading](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/03/nvidia-slides-in-post-market-trading-after-drop-wiped-out-300-billion.html). The chipmaker’s shares had already given up nearly 10% during regular trading Tuesday.

While the report did not specify a reason for regulators to be interested in Nvidia, the company’s recent rise has been directly tied to its dominance in artificial intelligence chips for data centers years before competitors AMD and Intel started taking the category seriously.

Nvidia has more than 80% of the data center AI chip market, according to industry estimates.

Nvidia “wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” Nvidia told CNBC.

707,2024-09-04,81,"Nordstrom founders offer $23 per share to take the department store private  Nordstrom’s founding family has offered to take the department store chain private for $23 a share, teaming up with a Mexico-based retailer in its latest bid, a filing showed on Wednesday.

That price would value the company at roughly $3.76 billion. Its shares have gained 35% since Reuters first reported in March that the family showed interest in taking Nordstrom private.

Nordstrom’s sales have been stronger of late than some of its peers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s as it focuses on stocking its shelves with trendier products.

The bidders include CEO Erik Nordstrom, President Peter Nordstrom and Mexican retailer El Puerto de Liverpool, who sent a non-binding letter proposing to form a new entity that would buy the chain, according to the filing.

The company in April confirmed the family’s interest in a potential deal and formed a special committee of independent directors to evaluate such a proposal.

The Nordstrom family owned about 54.6 million shares, or 33.4% stake in the company, as of Sept. 4. Liverpool owns 15.8 million shares, or nearly 10% of the shares.

The deal would be financed through a combination of rollover equity and cash from the Nordstrom family and Liverpool as well as $250 million in new bank financing.

In May, Reuters reported that Sycamore Partners had shown interest in taking the company private.

The chain was founded in 1901 by John Nordstrom, the great-grandfather of the current CEO and president.

In 2018, Nordstrom rejected a $8.4 billion bid from the family, saying it was too small and later ended discussions after failing to agree on a price.

37,2024-09-04,26,"Dollar Tree shares slide after discounter cuts full-year forecast  Shares of Dollar Tree fell more than 15% in early trading Wednesday after the discounter cut its full-year outlook, citing increasing pressures on middle-income and higher-income customers.

The retailer said it now expects its full-year consolidated net sales outlook to range between $30.6 billion and $30.9 billion. It expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.20 to $5.60. That compares with previous guidance of $31 billion to $32 billion in net sales and $6.50 to $7 for adjusted earnings per share.

In a news release, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Davis said the company cut the forecast to reflect softer sales and costs associated with converting 99 Cents Only stores. The company also said it has had higher expenses to reimburse, settle and litigate claims related to customer accidents and other incidents at stores.

Here’s how Dollar Tree did in its fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 3:

Earnings per share: 62 cents, it was not immediately clear if it was comparable to what analysts surveyed by LSEG expected

Revenue: $7.38 billion, it was not immediately clear if it was comparable

Dollar Tree’s report comes about a week after major rival Dollar General slashed its full-year sales and profit outlook, sending its shares tumbling. Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos chalked up weak sales to “a core customer who feels financially constrained.”

Dollar stores, in particular, have felt pinched as their core customer — shoppers with lower incomes and little leftover money to spend on discretionary items — makes trade-offs after a prolonged period of pricier food and everyday costs. Walmart has won more business from value-conscious shoppers across incomes and newer online players, such as Temu, have also attracted customers with cheap merchandise.

Dollar Tree includes two store chains, its namesake, which sells a wide variety of lower-priced items like party supplies, and Family Dollar, which carries more food.

Same-store sales for the company rose by 0.7% in the quarter. At Dollar Tree, same-store sales increased by 1.3% and at Family Dollar, same-store sales fell by 0.1%. The industry metric takes out the impact of store openings and closures.

On an earnings call, Davis said the company saw weaker sales, particularly on the discretionary side of the business. He said it “reflected the increasing effect of macro pressures on the purchasing behavior of the Dollar Tree’s middle- and higher-income customers.”

“Our original second-quarter outlook did not anticipate those pressures migrating to Dollar Tree’s customer base to the degree that they did,” he said.

Along with contending with inflation-stretched shoppers, Dollar Tree has faced company-specific challenges. The retailer announced in March that it would close about 1,000 Family Dollar stores, citing market conditions and store performance. Then, in June, the company said it is considering selling the Family Dollar brand.

Dollar Tree bought Family Dollar for nearly $9 billion in 2015 and since then, it’s struggled to strengthen the grocery-focused chain and better compete with Dollar General.

The liability claims also added to the company’s challenges. On the company’s earnings call, Davis said the outcome of claims, particularly older ones, “has become increasingly challenging to predict given the higher settlement and litigation costs that have resulted from a more volatile insurance environment.” 

“The claims have continued to develop unfavorably due to the rising cost to reimburse, settle, and litigate these claims, which impacted our actuarially determined liabilities,” he said.

As of Tuesday’s close, Dollar Tree’s shares are down nearly 43% so far this year. The company’s stock hit a 52-week low on Tuesday and closed the day at $81.65.

17,2024-09-04,1,"Dick's Sporting Goods blows past earnings estimates but issues cautious guidance  Dick’s Sporting Goods on Wednesday blew past Wall Street’s earnings estimates in its fiscal second quarter and while the retailer did raise its full-year guidance as a result, the new outlook fell flat up against expectations. 

The sporting goods store comes behind a string of other retailers that issued muted or cautious guidance for the back half of the fiscal year as companies prepare for the presidential election in November and what some fear could lead to a slowdown in consumer spending. 

Here’s how Dick’s did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $4.37 vs. $3.83 expected

Revenue: $3.47 billion vs. $3.44 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 was $362 million, or $4.37 per share, compared with $244 million, or $2.82 per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.47 billion, up about 8% from $3.22 billion a year earlier. Comparable sales climbed 4.5% -- ahead of the 3.6% that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.

In a statement, CEO Lauren Hobart said comparable sales were driven by both transactions and tickets -- indicating more people are coming to Dick’s stores and spending more while they’re there.

For fiscal 2024, Dick’s is now expecting diluted earnings per share to be between $13.55 and $13.90, up from previous guidance of $13.35 to $13.75 per share. At the midpoint, Dick’s only raised its earnings guidance by about 18 cents, even though its fiscal second-quarter earnings came in 54 cents higher than expected. At the low end, Dick’s earnings guidance falls a bit short of the $13.79 that analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Dick’s maintained its sales guidance of $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion, which also fell flat compared with the $13.24 billion that analysts were looking for, according to LSEG. The company did raise its projections for comparable sales growth and is now expecting them to grow between 2.5% and 3.5%, up from previous guidance of 2% to 3%. The high end of the guidance is ahead of the 3% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. 

Last week, the company disclosed in a securities filing that it was the victim of a cyberattack and “certain confidential information” was breached. Dick’s said that it activated its “cybersecurity response plan” as a result and engaged with external experts to investigate and isolate the threat.

In its filing, Dick’s said it didn’t have any knowledge of the breach disrupting business operations and based on the information it had, it didn’t believe the incident was material.

This time last year, Dick’s shocked investors when it said that theft – along with aggressive markdowns for languishing inventory – would impact its full-year profit expectations, sending its stock down 24%. At the time, profits were down about 23% but given Wednesday’s earnings beat, it appears as if those woes are now behind the company. 

A number of other retailers – including Target and Walmart – said over the last couple of weeks that shrink, or lost inventory from a range of factors including theft and damage, had moderated. One of the top issues that retailers said they were facing throughout 2023, shrink appears to be in the rearview mirror for some after making investments into operations, technology and a reduction in the use of self-checkout machines. 

Over the last few weeks, a range of retailers put out second-quarter numbers that beat expectations but issued guidance for the last two quarters of 2024 that were either muted or poor compared with the company’s performance. Retailers have been bracing themselves for the upcoming election in November and the impact it could have on consumer spending. Beyond the election, there’s also uncertainties tied to the Federal Reserve’s expected rate cut and the impact that could have on discretionary spending. 

Dick’s is slated to discuss its results with analysts and share more insights on its guidance at 8 a.m. ET.

192,2024-09-04,114,"[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

1,2024-09-04,1,"Deciding between Vanguard og Invesco S&P EURO ETF My country is blocking sales of dollar ETFs so I have to transition away from SPY. I have my eyes on Vanguards VUAA or VUSA and Invescos P500 or D500. The latter tickers are dividend while the former are accumulated. 

Firstly im unsure whats best to choose between dividend or accumulated. I'd like to hear your thoughts on that. Secondly I need to choose between Vanguard or Invesco. 

Vanguards VUAA seems to be the most recommended on this subreddit. But P500 seems to have a lower annual fee and spread at 0,05% and 0,01% respectivly. Compared to VUAA's 0,07% and 0,03% Similar numbers count for the non-dividend versions. 

So wouldn't it be a nobrainer to choose Invesco since they are cheaper?

26,2024-09-04,13,"Alibaba to allow payment through Tencent's WeChat Pay on e-commerce apps Chinese tech giant Alibaba on Wednesday said that its core Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms will now allow payment through Tencent’s WeChat app for the first time.

Previously, Alibaba’s Chinese e-commerce sites only accepted limited payment options and pushed WeChat Pay rival Alipay as one of the main ways to pay. Alipay is run by Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba that was also founded by Jack Ma.

“We have always been open to collaborations, and have actively explored interoperability and partnerships with our peers,” an Alibaba spokesperson told CNBC. “We are constantly working to enhance user experience by making shopping more convenient, enjoyable, and efficient.”

Taobao and Tmall will likely begin accepting payments through WeChat Pay this month, a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to disclose the details publicly, told CNBC.

The historic move comes as Alibaba looks to reignite growth in its China e-commerce business, which has been under pressure from a sluggish Chinese consumer and from competitors like JD.com amd Temu-owner PDD.

Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu has previously said that the Taobao and Tmall business should return to growth toward the latter half of the firm’s fiscal year 2025.

WeChat has more than 1.3 billion users globally, the majority of whom is located in China. WeChat Pay is one of the biggest mobile payments apps in the country.

By allowing users to transact through WeChat Pay on Taobao and Tmall, Alibaba could therefore increase its market share in less developed parts of China, the source said.

The company’s biggest rival JD.com has also allowed WeChat Pay to be used on its platform for a long time.

Another theme in the background is the regulatory scrutiny that Beijing has put on Chinese technology companies, urging these firms to bring down their so-called walled gardens that block competitors’ products.

Alibaba and Tencent are two of China’s largest internet companies that have built dominance through their sprawling services, which often center around their so-called super apps. That prominance created a situation where, for a long time, rivals would not allow access to each others’ services on their respective platforms.

Tech giants started to change these practices over the past few years, amid criticism from regulators. In 2021, Tencent began allowing users to access external links in one-on-one chats. For example, if someone shared a link from Alibaba’s Taobao in WeChat, a user would be able to open that without leaving the messaging app. That same year, some of Alibaba’s other apps began supporting WeChat Pay.

Last week, China’s market regulator said Alibaba had completed a three-year regulatory “rectification” process following a 18.23 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) antitrust fine the company received in 2021.

95,2024-09-04,79,"Why are people opposed to antitrust probes or merger blocks? Antitrust courts and merger blocks are necessary for a competitive market to work for all economic actors in a capitalist system. There are countless economy studies about it and how it is actually better for all economic actors to not have monopolies, duopolies etc.  

Now reading comments on this sub, it seems like people are experts in this difficult domain of antitrust law and almost always side with the companies that potentially break the law. 

Why is that? Even if you have shares in that company, you will end up better by having a competitive market. I.e. we are all nvidia shareholders if you bought S&P, but it would be better for other companies (and long-term for S&P) to fight a monopoly if there is one and ensure that the rules are respected and nobody abuses a monopoly. 

To me this anti FTC, anti DOJ reaction is short sighted and hurts the long term interests of all shareholders, no matter what shares you bought.

30% of my portfolio is GOOG stock and I believe the DoJ case is the best thing that happens to them. A monopolist is lazy, ineficient, not innovating enough because they have their revenue secured. No matter the DoJ decision, it will be breaking the status quo and push GOOG to innovate and create more value for shareholders. The same thing for NVDA. Long term, the worst for them is to be a monopolist and maintain the status quo. Until they become Boeing.

TLDR: No matter what stock you bought, if you are in for the long term, it is in your interest for all the companies to play by the rules and have a competitive, anti-monopolistic, market."

0,2024-09-04,102,"Am I missing something or are we due for a crash within 6 months? Ok so the way I see things, buffett indicator is at nearly 200% (2 stdevs above average), yield curve is longest and deepest its been in a long time (possibly ever) and is on the precipice of uninverting (Fed cutting interest rates suggests this will happen soon). July SAHM was > 0.5 (indicative but not conclusive of recession for now - need 3 months).

Add to this geopolitical tensions in the middle east, Ukraine and China creating an environment that is at the very least fraught with risk and at worst very inflationary (and noting that war often follows recessions), and all I see is a pretty nasty, probably double dip recession on the horizon (by mid next year and probably earlier) with a stock market correction of 20-50%.

As you can tell - this is very bearish. What am I not seeing that bulls are? At a bare minimum I see T bills as the correct play given rates are still nice and if one wanted to really get them tendies then go all in on SQQQ...I know this sounds moronic but I also dont see what else is seriously investable at this point.

6,2024-09-04,10,"Will I get more interest from SPAXX at Fidelity Brokerage (pay very early) versus SPAXX at Chase Self-Direct Investment (pay very late) I hold the mutual fund SPAXX at **Fidelity Brokerage** and at **Chase Self-Direct Investment** at the same time. I choose the ""dividend reinvest"" option with both brokers. SPAXX at Fidelity is ""Money Market"" so it is automatically reinvested.

Over this long weekend, I realized that there is some substantial difference in the pay date of the dividend (interest) between Fidelity Brokerage and Chase Self-Directed Investment for the mutual fund SPAXX. Fidelity gave me the dividend from SPAXX on as early as Friday, 8/30/2024. But as of now, 9/3/2024 Tuesday evening at 9pm, Chase still hasn't given me anything from SPAXX. Note 9/2/2024 is Labor Day.

I wonder eventually Chase will give me the exactly the same amount (I mean ""rate"") of interest payment from SPAXX, or while Chase pays the dividend from SPAXX **at least four days later than** the date of SPAXX payment from Fidelity, I will not be able to collect the interest for at least four days from the money of the previous month's generated interest? I know the dividend generated from reinvested dividend is very little compared to the principal but it is still quite a bit...

To make my question more concise, are there any monetary differences between buying SPAXX at Fidelity, versus buying SPAXX at Chase Self-invested (with dividend re-invest chosen in both cases)？(I hold different amount of SPAXX in two places for a short period of time so doing the math here is a bit of challenge for me...)"
323,2024-09-03,294,"If September is historically a bad month for stocks, is there anything stopping people from selling their stocks just for September? I haven't paid attention to economics until very recently, so apologies in advance if this is a fairly simple question.

As someone who just started learning about investing ands stocks, I came across many people saying that ""September is the worst month for stocks"". So this got me wondering: if we know that September has had a bad history for a long time, what stops people from just selling all(or at least most of) their stocks for the month and buying them back towards the end of the month?

The possibilities that I thought of were:

1. It doesn't matter for long term investors (wouldn't it be better to keep your number as it is than to have it drop a few %?)
2. The past is not an indicator of the future (even though that does seem to be a strong trend?)
3. You may miss out on a possible positive return (I think this relates to the issue of ""trying to time the market"" which I would find valid for long term investors.)

Are there any other reasons for this, such as taxes or other complicated issues I am not aware of?

  
Edit: I didn't expect so many responses, but I read all of them and they were very helpful in answering my curiosity. It was interesting to learn a little bit more about investing, and it seems like there's still so much more for me to learn. Thank you all for the kind responses!"
756,2024-09-03,302,"Nvidia Gets DOJ Subpoena in Escalating Antitrust Probe [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-gets-doj-subpoena-in-escalating-antitrust-investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-gets-doj-subpoena-in-escalating-antitrust-investigation)

The US Justice Department sent subpoenas to Nvidia Corp. and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws, an escalation of its investigation into the dominant AI computing provider.

The DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide it with information, according to people familiar with the investigation. That takes the government probe a step closer to launching a formal complaint.

Antitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don’t exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.

Nvidia shares, which suffered a record-setting rout on Monday, fell further in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the subpoenas. Still, the stock has more than doubled this year — fueled by explosive sales growth at the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker.

As part of the probe, which Bloomberg previously reported on in June, investigators have been contacting other technology companies to gather information. The DOJ’s San Francisco office is taking the lead running the inquiry, the people said.

Representatives for DOJ and Nvidia declined to comment."
1,2024-09-03,10,"Trying to understand capital gains distributions People seem to think of a large capital gains distribution from a mutual fund as a bad thing. (A distribution in the tens of thousands, say, or one worth 10-15% of your holding in that mutual fund. See Vanguard VTIVX in 2021 for a recent example).

But why exactly? This isn't meant as a rhetorical question. I'm wondering what I'm missing. The value of the fund's share price will go down in line with the distribution. So the net effect there is 0. You have to pay capital gains tax, but you would have to do this anyway if and when you sold the stock.

If one were a pure dividend income investor, wouldn't this be an opportunity to buy more dividend-bearing stocks in this same fund, or via another investment? You might be taking a hit in terms of total value, for now at least, but you get the opportunity to increase your dividend income by buying more shares (and wouldn't the fund's share price be lower in fact, because of the distribution?).

It's obviously a hassle to have to account for a large distribution you weren't expecting, and for the time and manner of that distribution to be outside of your control. But that doesn't seem like enough to inspire the dread and sometimes rage a large CGD seems to produce in some people. So what's the reason for that?

All insights appreciated. "

I only recently switched (3 weeks ago) to putting my biweekly investments in the lower expense fund. Would it be better to hold the existing SWLSX shares until they hit 1 year, to avoid short term capital gains tax. Or should I just immediately cash them out now and turn around and buy SWLGX, avoiding the 1% expense. "
7,2024-09-03,24,"Yen Carry Trade: The God-Tier degen strategy or a ticking time bomb? Alright, let’s discuss the yen carry trade, aka how the big dogs like Buffett and Cuban have been milking the Japanese yen for years.  
And what it means for the stock market aka what happened today.

This is what they do: borrow yen at near-zero interest rates, convert it to USD, and throw it into stocks or other assets with fat returns.  
This worked because Japan’s central bank was practically allergic to raising rates (until recently).  
It’s been like printing money for them.

The kicker?  
As the yen kept falling, these guys got to enjoy even lower debt costs. Easy money, right?

But here’s the twist—Japan finally hiked rates for the first time in a decade, and the yen is starting to bite back. Buffett’s now trimming his Apple stake, and some think it’s because his yen bet might be going south.  
So, who’s still playing this game big time, and how do we stick it to them if the yen suddenly pops?  
Remember, this could be the mother of all squeezes if things flip.

170,2024-09-03,55,"MarketWatch: September is historically the worst month for U.S. stocks. What investors need to know. **September is historically the worst month for U.S. stocks. What investors need to know.**  
[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/september-is-historically-the-worst-month-for-u-s-stocks-what-investors-need-to-know-4b5fd927](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/september-is-historically-the-worst-month-for-u-s-stocks-what-investors-need-to-know-4b5fd927)

  
*The U.S. stock market finished a turbulent month on a positive note after recovering from a bout of heavy selling on Aug. 5 that plunged Wall Street to its worst day in nearly two years.*  
*But if the past is any guide, seasonal weakness in September could spoil the momentum via a heightened level of volatility in the financial markets.*   
*History suggests September is the worst month of the year in terms of stock-market performance. The S&P 500 SPX has generated an average monthly decline of 1.2% and finished higher only 44.3% of the time dating back to 1928, according to Dow Jones Market Data.*   
*The historical performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and the Nasdaq Composite COMP also indicates stocks could experience a lackluster period in September, with the two indexes delivering an average monthly drop of 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively. The Dow has recorded positive returns in September only 41.7% of the time since 1897, while the Nasdaq has finished higher 54.1% of the time since 1971, according to Dow Jones Market Data.*   
*“The summer vacation cycle ends \[in September\] and people go back to their desks to trade stocks again. In fact, September is the second-highest month for trading volume of the whole year,” Liz Young Thomas, head of investment strategy at SoFi, said in emailed commentary on Thursday.*   
*Trading volume usually remains light in the summer months, with July and August on average seeing the lowest number of shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, according to FactSet data.*   
*More trading activity can lead to more volatility in the stock market, Young Thomas told MarketWatch in a follow-up interview on Friday. The S&P 500’s strong gains during the summer months of 2024, as well as its quick recovery from the Aug. 5 rout may prompt investors to “reposition” their portfolios after “a period of returns that’s maybe a little bit outsized,” she added.*   
*“If people have been away or haven’t done as much trading as usual through the summer, they come back in September and realize they’ve got a bunch of gains in their equity portion,” Young Thomas said. “You could see people take some gains in September just to get that positioning in the right place.”*  
*Meanwhile, September brings what could be the start of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate-cutting cycle — if inflation and labor-market data between now and the Fed’s Sept. 17-18 meeting still keeps the door open for rate reductions.*  
*“We are in a period where we’re looking down the barrel of our first rate cut in a very long time … \[but\] markets are just not quite accustomed to that yet,” Young Thomas noted. “We’ve been hearing \[about\] rate cuts and been anticipating them in a positive way, but there’s really no guarantee that they will end up being positive for the duration of that cutting cycle.”*   
*Last Friday’s PCE inflation data looked likely to keep the Fed on a path to cutting rates three times this year by 25 basis points each, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. But investors haven’t ruled out the chance of a more aggressive, 50-basis-point cut should this week’s August employment data show further slowing in the labor market.*   
*Adding to potential volatility in the stock market is the upcoming U.S. presidential election. The S&P 500’s historical performance during election years suggests stocks could experience a lackluster and volatile period between now and Nov. 5, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told MarketWatch last month.*  
*However, portfolio managers at Little Harbor Advisors said there’s no “imminent worry” in the stock market in September as Wall Street’s closely watched “fear gauge,” the Cboe Volatility Index VIX, has been in a free fall after peaking above 65 in early August.*   
*The VIX has fallen 77% since Aug. 5 to remain well below its long-term average of around 20 as of Friday afternoon, according to FactSet data.*  
*“Hedging is something you need to be very careful with, because hedging when nothing’s happening is very expensive,” said Matthew Thompson, portfolio manager at Little Harbor Advisors.*  
*“We prefer to wait until we see signs in the VIX \[that it is surging\], and that’s where we’re going to start to hedge,” Thompson told MarketWatch on Friday. “You will get a lot of calendar items that could get \[the VIX\] moving in September, but as of now, we’re just watching and waiting.”*  
*U.S. stocks finished August with monthly gains on Friday. The S&P 500 advanced 2.3% last month, while the Dow gained 1.8% and the Nasdaq rose 0.7% for the month, according to FactSet data.*"

65,2024-09-03,78,"Taiwan semiconductor Manufacturing Company Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment?

Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow.

Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion.

Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?"

# [Stock futures slide to kick off September trading: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures declined Tuesday as traders braced for a potentially tough month ahead after a strong but volatile August.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 197 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.6%.
*****
> U.S. markets were closed Monday due to the Labor Day holiday.
*****
> The major averages are coming off a winning session, securing a gain for major averages in the month. Notably, the S&P 500 clinched its fourth straight winning month.
*****
> Those moves came after a steep sell-off to begin the month. Concern over the U.S. economy falling into a recession, along with the unwinding of a popular hedge fund trade involving the Japanese yen, sent stocks tumbling in early August. At one point, the S&P 500 was down more than 7% for the month before recovering.
*****
> “August got off to an incredibly rough start,” wrote Deutsche Bank macro strategist Henry Allen. “But after August 5, calm began to return to markets. In part, that was helped by more positive data on the US economy, which helped to ease fears about an imminent recession.”
*****
> Investors will get their first major economic report of the month on Friday, when the U.S. government releases the August jobs report. Wall Street will also have to contend with seasonal headwinds, as September has been the worst month on average for the S&P 500 over the last 10 years.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

0,2024-09-03,64,"Does anyone actually hold SPY long term? My uncle (65) and I were talking after his fathers funeral and he's trying to figure out why his father (who died at 95),  was holding only 1 ETF, SPY. The capital gains are so insane that we're not sure how to part ways with it and move to something like VTI or VOO, IVV, etc.

We've met several ""shady"" people who are willing to ""exchange"" (as in something like 1031) the assets in return for a ""fee"".

In any case, while that discussion continues on, I wanted to know does anyone actually hold SPY long term (outside my uncle's father)?

The theory right now is that he invested in SPY when it was launched due to his connection with Boston Life Insurance companies or something, reinvested the dividends and the rest is history.

So this brings me to people here. Has anyone held SPY for say 10 years?"
33,2024-09-03,23,"What's with the differences in returns between S&P 500 trackers? Hey all, just a quick question.

  
Looking at things like SWPPX, SPY, VOO, etc --- they all track the S&P 500, but they also have returned slightly different growth over time. Do they not all track the same stocks and should therefore logically return the same amount? Is it just a difference in expense ratios? Slight difference in dividends?

* A brokerage has on-the-phone customer service.

987,2024-09-02,284,"Intel CEO will reportedly present plans to cut assets at an emergency board meeting According to Reuters reports, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger and other key executives are to present their plan to trim Intel's fat and course-correct the company. The meeting will focus on removing assets and reducing costs, with items of discussion apparently including Intel's upcoming Magdeburg, Germany fab and its ownership of Altera.

Intel announced a $1.6 billion loss in its now-infamous August 1 earnings call, which also carried the news that Intel had laid off 15% of its workforce and aims to reduce spending by $10 billion by 2025. The loss came thanks to Intel's falling behind in the AI arms race and its 13th/14th-generation widespread CPU failures. Intel stock had its worst day in 50 years immediately following the call, and the company has continued to suffer in the month since. Chip industry legend Lip-Bu Tan resigned from the board of executives, resulting in a 6% drop in Intel stock and a significant lack of industry experience.

Significant changes to Intel were always likely to reverse this major downturn, but recent reports reveal that Gelsinger's plans may include seriously drastic measures. Construction on Intel's upcoming Magdeburg chip fab is expected to be paused or canceled, leaving the $32 billion project unfinished. Magdeburg's local government has already begun drafting plans in case Intel withdraws its commitment to the project.

Intel is also likely to sell off its ownership of Altera, its programmable chip business, which is currently a fully spun-off company owned solely by Intel. Altera has been an industry fixture for decades, with Intel investing heavily in reviving Altera after acquiring the company in 2015. Altera has been a part of Intel's broad market strategy for ten years but is likely to be entirely sold off to another interested chip manufacturer in the coming months.

Unsurprisingly, Intel is not expected to entertain discussion about spinning off or selling its Intel Foundry wing. Intel's contract foundry business, one of Intel's most significant expenses, has been kept distinct from the rest of Intel's business since Q1 2024 and is considered a tentpole part of Intel's future. Two separate sources have confirmed that Intel will not propose any plans to sell its foundry wing to TSMC or another similar buyer, keeping it around for the day it is hopefully as profitable as Gelsinger believes it can be.

Intel's sharp decline can be attributed to several factors. Lip-Bu Tan reportedly blamed his exit from Intel on a bloated workforce, and Gelsinger blamed expenditures across the board as a major problem. Intel is still mired in issues related to the instability and failure rate of 13th and 14th Generation CPUs, which could lead to permanent chip damage. Tech media heavily reported Intel's lethargic response to a disastrous product failure, leading to increased public distrust of Intel's brand. While selling off companies will help quell Intel's bleeding out; the company has a long road ahead to stability.

Disney Entertainment channels went dark on DirecTV Sunday night after the sides were unable to reach a new carriage agreement.

The move angered some sports fans, who posted their displeasure on social media. And the U.S. Tennis Association wasn’t pleased with another carriage dispute.

ESPN was showing the fourth round of the U.S. Open when it went off the air on DirecTV at 7:20 p.m. EDT.

That was a half-hour before the start of the match between Frances Tiafoe, an American who reached the 2022 U.S. Open semifinals, and Alexei Popyrin, an Australian who eliminated defending champion Novak Djokovic on Friday.

“It is disappointing that fans and viewers around the country will not have the opportunity to watch the greatest athletes in our sport take part in the 2024 U.S. Open due to an unresolved negotiation between DirecTV and Disney, resulting in the loss of access to ESPN. We are hopeful that this dispute can be resolved as quickly as possible,” the USTA said in a statement.

It also happened 10 minutes before the start of the college football game between No. 13 LSU and 23rd-ranked Southern California in Las Vegas.

ABC-owned stations in Los Angeles; the San Francisco Bay Area; Fresno, California; New York; Chicago; Philadelphia; Houston; and Raleigh, North Carolina, also went off DirecTV.

Last year, Disney and Spectrum — the nation’s second-largest cable TV provider — were involved in a nearly 12-day impasse until coming to an agreement hours before the first Monday night NFL game of the season.

DirecTV said Disney offered an extension to keep the channels on the air in exchange for DirecTV having to waive all future legal claims that its behavior is anti-competitive.

“The Walt Disney Co. is once again refusing any accountability to consumers, distribution partners, and now the American judicial system,” said Rob Thun, DirecTV’s chief content officer, in a statement. “Disney is in the business of creating alternate realities, but this is the real world where we believe you earn your way and must answer for your own actions. They want to continue to chase maximum profits and dominant control at the expense of consumers — making it harder for them to select the shows and sports they want at a reasonable price.”

DirecTV has 11.3 million subscribers, according to Leichtman Research Group, making it the nation’s third-largest pay TV provider.

Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, co-chairmen of Disney Entertainment, and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro issued a joint statement urging DirecTV to finalize a deal.

The statement added that “while we’re open to offering DirecTV flexibility and terms which we’ve extended to other distributors, we will not enter into an agreement that undervalues our portfolio of television channels and programs. We invest significantly to deliver the No. 1 brands in entertainment, news and sports because that’s what our viewers expect and deserve.”

The impasse comes as networks and distributors continue to be at odds over content. Distributors and subscribers would like to see a model where they can buy channels a la carte instead of subscribing to a bundling package.

Distributors are also frustrated with production companies putting some of their premium programing on direct-to-consumer platforms before they show up on channels. DirecTV cited the miniseries “Shogun” appearing on Hulu before FX.

“Consumer frustration is at an all-time high as Disney shifts its best producers, most innovative shows, top teams, conferences, and entire leagues to their direct-to-consumer services while making customers pay more than once for the same programming on multiple Disney platforms,” Thun said. “Disney’s only magic is forcing prices to go up while simultaneously making its content disappear.”

Besides all ESPN network channels and ABC-owned stations, Disney-branded channels Freeform, FX and National Geographic channel went dark on DirecTV.

0,2024-09-02,1,"Arrowhead presents new pivotal Phase 3 data from PALISADE study of Plozasiran  Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals announced results from the Phase 3 PALISADE study of investigational plozasiran in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, a severe and rare genetic disease which currently has no approved treatments in the U.S. PALISADE successfully met its primary endpoint and all multiplicity-controlled key secondary endpoints, including statistically significant reductions in triglycerides, apolipoprotein C-III, and the incidence of acute pancreatitis. These data were presented today in a late-breaking oral presentation at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2024 and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Based on these positive findings from the PALISADE study, Arrowhead intends to file a New Drug Application with the United States Food and Drug Administration by year-end 2024 and plans to seek regulatory approval with additional global regulatory authorities thereafter.  
 
In PALISADE, 75 patients with persistent chylomicronemia, with or without a genetic diagnosis, were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous plozasiran at 25 mg or 50 mg or placebo every three months for 12 months. At baseline, the median triglyceride level was 2044 mg/dL. Forty-four patients had genetically confirmed FCS and 31 patients had clinically diagnosed persistent chylomicronemia suggestive of FCS. At month ten, the median reduction from baseline in the fasting triglyceride level was -80% in the 25 mg plozasiran group, -78% in the 50 mg plozasiran group, and -17% in the placebo group.  
 
Marked reductions in the median triglyceride level below guideline-directed risk thresholds associated with acute pancreatitis occurred as early as one month after trial initiation and showed modest variation throughout the 12-month blinded treatment period. The mean percentage change in triglyceride level was similar to median values. At month ten, APOC3 was significantly reduced with median reductions of -93% in the 25 mg plozasiran group, -96% in the 50 mg plozasiran group, and -1% in the placebo group. The final alpha-controlled secondary efficacy end point compared the incidence of positively adjudicated acute pancreatitis in a pre-specified pooled analysis of the 25 mg and the 50 mg plozasiran groups versus the pooled placebo group. 
 
 Among the 38 suspected cases of acute pancreatitis that were referred for adjudication, nine episodes in seven patients were positively adjudicated. Plozasiran demonstrated statistical significance for this endpoint, with patients receiving plozasiran achieving an 83% reduction in the risk of developing acute pancreatitis versus placebo. A total of two cases occurred in two of 50 patients receiving plozasiran, and seven cases occurred in five of 25 patients receiving placebo. Plozasiran demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the PALISADE study."
126,2024-09-02,60,"BYD sales hit a record in August despite broader China EV slowdown  Chinese electric car giant BYD sold a record number of passenger vehicles in August, with sales of hybrids growing faster than those of battery-only cars.

The company said August sales rose by 30% year-on-year to 370,854 passenger cars.

Its sales of battery-only cars rose by nearly 12%, while hybrid-powered vehicle sales surged by 48% to account for just under two-thirds of BYD cars sold last month.

In contrast, several new energy vehicle startups saw a dip in deliveries last month.

Li Auto, best known for its range-extender vehicles, reported 48,122 deliveries in August, down from a record 51,000 in July.

Aito, which uses Huawei technology, said it delivered 31,216 cars last month, down by more than 10,000 vehicles from the prior month. Huawei is selling the Aito trademark and patents to automaker Seres for 2.5 billion yuan ($352.5 million).

Lower-priced cars hitting the market

Nio said it delivered 20,176 cars in August, down slightly from July but above 20,000 for a fourth-straight month.

The company’s lower-priced brand Onvo opened 105 stores on Sunday as it prepares to begin for deliveries for its first car, the L60 SUV, this month. Nio is scheduled to report earnings on Friday.

Xpeng reported 14,036 car deliveries in August, its best month for the year so far.

The company said on Friday it began some deliveries of its newly launched, mass market Mona M03 electric car that sells for the equivalent of less than $20,000 in China. It was not clear whether those M03 deliveries were included in the total figure Xpeng reported.

Geely-backed Zeekr reported a month-on-month increase to 18,015 deliveries in August, but that was down from 20,206 deliveries in June.

Undercutting Tesla and going global

Zeekr on Friday said it would launch its first SUV this month with a price more than $1,400 lower than Tesla’s Model Y. The U.S.-listed Chinese company said it aims to deliver the SUV globally by the end of this year, but did not specify which countries or regions.

BYD said it sold 31,451 cars overseas last month, pushing the year-to-date total to 264,869 and above the 242,765 cars it sold abroad for all of last year.

If BYD keeps up its average monthly overseas sales pace through the end of December, the company will sell just under 400,000 cars outside China this year, according to CNBC calculations.

Xiaomi only said it delivered more than 10,000 cars in August for a third-straight month. In mid-July, CEO Lei Jun said the company aimed to deliver 100,000 units of its SU7 electric sedan by the end of November.

That indicates Xiaomi needs to deliver an average of at least 16,000 cars a month from August to November, according to CNBC calculations of reported data.

The smartphone company began mass deliveries of the SU7 in April at a price about $4,000 less than Tesla’s Model 3.

50,2024-09-02,47,"Value investing in big companies So according to Buffets philosophy, you should only buy undervalued businesses, and you can get a good idea of this depending on the P/E ratio and discounted cash flow analysis. However, from my understanding, if you carry out a DCF model on big companies such as Microsoft and Apple, it always suggests that the company is overvalued.

However, these big companies have continued to rise significantly in price over the years.

28,2024-09-02,144,"Thinking about selling part of an ETF to buy NVDA stock I have an ETF from Vanguard Admiral Shares (VFIAX). One of the top ten holdings is NVDA.  I want to sell about 10K worth to buy NVDA if it falls close to 100. I already own NVDA which I bought 3 years ago at 30. Since then, those shares have outperformed anything else in my portfolio. My reasoning: NVDA will outperform the ETF.

I believe NVDA will see explosive growth in the next 5 years, beyond that timeframe, who knows. I plan to hold it for at least 5 years (or until I see weakness). 

I should add that this ETF was inherited and will need to be liquidated by 2030.

406,2024-09-01,125,"Historically, September has been one of the weaker months for the S&P 500. Over the long term, the average return for the S&P 500 in September has typically been negative or close to zero. For instance, from 1928 through 2023, the average return in September has been around -0.5% to -1%. However, these figures can vary slightly depending on the specific time period and market conditions being analyzed. It's worth noting that while September is historically weaker, past performance isn't necessarily indicative of future results."
145,2024-09-01,141,"What do you guys think about the current PE ratio of S&P 500, which is 29.5 and well above the historical average?  (Reposting because the original post had good discussion going on but mods deleted it for ""self-promotion"" which was strange. I assume that was for mentioning a popular podcast. Hopefully, this post stays.)

Here is the chart of PE ratio - [https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio) . Even looking at only the past 15 years, 29.5 is very high and is only below the COVID highs - but the COVID high is artificial because the earnings dropped like a rock due to lockdowns. The only other time 29+ was reached was before the 2000 and 2008 crashes.

Here is another website with forward PE estimate - [https://www.gurufocus.com/economic\_indicators/6061/sp-500-pe-ratio-with-forward-estimate](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/6061/sp-500-pe-ratio-with-forward-estimate) . This says a different story - forward PE estimate is apparently at 22 for 2025! I assume this means they expect earnings to bump up by 30-40%! That's the only way PE can go from 29 to 22 afaik (well unless the stock price goes down).

I was looking around a bit regarding this and came across something called Shiller PE ratio - [https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) - ""Price earnings ratio is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years, known as the Cyclically Adjusted PE Ratio (CAPE Ratio), Shiller PE Ratio, or PE 10"". This also looks similar to PE ratio and seems to peak just before every recession, but I don't understand it fully (for comparison with normal PE - [https://www.gurufocus.com/economic\_indicators/57/sp-500-pe-ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/57/sp-500-pe-ratio) ). Even this says that the ratio is well well above historical average and is only comparable to 2000 levels.

Is the expected growth in next few years high enough to justify the high prices? Is this time different?

I'm not here claiming anything but just want to know what people think."
38,2024-09-01,48,"Fidelity vs Schwab I have my retirement accounts with Fidelity and my general account with Schwab and want to consolidate into one brokerage.  Curious as to what any of you say if you have experience with both?

My thoughts:

- Fidelity automatically pays you good interest on cash balance, Schwab requires you to manually move money.  This is my #1 reason I’m considering Fidelity. 

- Fidelity offers some free and reduced rate trades where Schwab does not on some options and otc. Not a major plus but a nice fringe benefit might save me $50-$100 year.

- Schwab UI/UX is superior on iOS app.  Website is also a little better IMO.  This is my #1 reason I’m considering Schwab.

- Schwab iOS app is glitchy and Fidelity appears stable.  More annoying than anything but concerned the app might not work when I really need it to.

- TOS vs active trader pro don’t appear to have any major differences?  I haven’t used Fidelity’s yet but it seems to offer the same service as TOS.. NEUTRAL imo but interested to hear any thoughts."

1,2024-09-01,7,"Question about how ETF's function Just curious about this as it has crossed my mind a number of times.  Does the Buy:Sell ratio of an ETF directly affect its price or is the price controlled by the ETF managers and tied directly to the NAV?

For arguments sake and illustrative purposes on what I'm asking, let's say we have a very small ETF that trades exclusively in Megacap stocks, and the moves the ETF makes do not impact the stocks it buys sells at all or more than a couple pennies.  On one particular day, for whatever reason, nobody is buying the ETF and everyone is placing market sell orders.  At the same time, all the stocks the ETF invests in are up, way way up.  Does the ETF move up or down that day?"
43,2024-09-01,87,"Does quantitative research matter anymore for the average person? I don't believe the market is 100 percent efficient, but it could be 99 percent. Yes, I  am making up a percent. There are so many people looking at stocks, and with the internet and computers, that I think any quantitative factor would be seen almost instantly. For your average person, I'm wondering if there is any advantage to looking at the numbers anymore. You might look at the basics in order to get a general idea of what you are buying into, but if you think you have a competitive edge, you are most likely wrong.

So if the numbers in the balance sheet and income statement are priced in, what is worth looking at? Qualitative reasons may be harder to price in. Even then, with A.I., millions or more of intelligent people looking at the market, it's still tough to have an advantage.

The more I study the market, the more I think stock picking is almost never worth  it. I still pick individual stocks for the fun of it, but I realize how tough it is to beat ETFs.

Edit: To clarify, I'm not saying that market inefficiency can't be found in numbers. I'm saying that your average guy will have a tough time using numbers on reports to find those discrepancy. Yes, I'm sure the top 1 percent of the 1 percent can find price mismatches and use to their advantage. I think the market is only becoming more efficient over time due to the internet and computer technology, so it doesn't do much good for the Average person."

* If there is no flood, then you lose 100% of the contract value, but the insurance price was cheap compared to the property anyways, so no worries.
* If there is a flood and your house loses half its value, your insurance policy is now worth 50% the value of the property, which is a lot compared to what you paid.

Dumb people take it to the extreme. Instead of buying 1 contract for 1 property, they dump their entire portfolio buying 1000 contracts on 1 property. And when the insurance expires unused, they scream ""I lost all my money buying contracts. It's literally gambling.""

0,2024-08-31,59,"Buying stocks with the intent of selling them in 8 months 25 y/o first time investor here. I have some cash lying around and cannot decide between investing in stocks and putting it in a EU bank account that offers 3.75% annual interest. 

Investment in stocks would have been a no brainer if I did not have to withdraw the entire sum in around 8 months from now. Even with the 8 month deadline, I would have invested in stocks but between the US elections in November and a jittery market, I feel the future is even more volatile.

It feels like a major market correction is coming. The first week of August showed how uneasy the market feels. While AI is undoubtedly going to get bigger in future, many will agree that the tech stocks are overvalued today.

If the market correction comes in the next 8 months, I will be screwed. Particularly so if the crash happens in Q1-Q2 2025 because I will need to withdraw my savings no matter what by H1 2025.

Getting an interest of 3.75% seems like a better deal. What are your thoughts? Are there any other investment options I should look into? I am a beginner and F&O seems too advanced for me.
 

Edit for context: I put 80% of my savings into stocks in the first week of August (a rookie mistake) and made a decent profit of 10%. Sold all the stocks last week. That has made me a bit greedy and reckless I guess. By putting the money into a high interest fixed deposit, I would be assuming that a market correction will *definitely* happen in less than 8 months from now, which is a bold assumption (and hence the confusion)."
74,2024-08-31,69,"So will Jumia ever become the Amazon of Africa, or something remotely close to it? Jumia was an interesting stock back in 2020/2021, seemed like everyone was talking about it in the bull market. After seeing success stories like Mercado Libre and Sea Limited I couldn’t help but buy a few shares of Jumia around $20. The problem is that you sort of have to believe in the African growth story for the thesis to work out long term.

It seems like Africa lacks the infrastructure to handle logistics, like there are not even street addresses in some areas of Africa. Many countries have weaker financial institutions including a large unbanked population without checking accounts. And the internet penetration rates can be really low in some countries.

I feel like at certain inflection point of development in emerging markets there will most likely not be a country or region that will be an exception to increasing e-commerce adoption. But even though Jumia as a first mover advantage, I’m not sure if they’ll be the company to revolutionize e-commerce in Africa if wide e-commerce adoption is even possible in Africa at the moment.

Do we think that the bull thesis is still intact for Jumia. Or is it a sell?"

827,2024-08-31,466,"I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. 

1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. 

3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.

2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. 

3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. 

4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.

5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up.

6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue ""short squeeze"" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved."
559,2024-08-30,184,"Intel working with bankers to present board with strategic options, sending shares up 8% Intel executives are working with multiple advisors to formulate options to address its [flagging business](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/intel-intc-gelsinger-skepticism-activist-layoffs.html), according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

Those advisors, which include Morgan Stanley and other bankers, will likely present Intel’s directors with options at an upcoming board meeting in September, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. The advisors are considering a full range of options, including splitting off and selling businesses, the person said.

Intel shares rose more than 8% on the report in Friday morning trading.

[Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/intel-is-said-to-explore-options-to-cope-with-historic-slump) first reported that the company was working with its advisors to come up with strategic options. Spokespeople for Intel and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

CEO Pat Gelsinger acknowledged publicly on Thursday that the company understood investor skepticism and was working to address it.

“We realize we have to operate efficiently with nimbleness, with urgency,” Gelsinger said at Deutsche Bank’s Technology Conference. CNBC previously reported that some advisors, including Morgan Stanley, were helping the company on activism defense.

Intel remains on track to launch its next iteration of its laptop central processor, Lunar Lake, Gelsinger said at the appearance. But investors don’t see a turnaround on the horizon, and have pushed the stock down almost 60% this year.

The once-dominant company has been trounced primarily by Nvidia, which produces the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are are the heart of today’s prominent AI models.

Alongside a disastrous earnings report earlier this month, Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 workers. The job cuts, part of a broader focus on slashing expenses, did little to assuage investor dismay. And while Gelsinger said Thursday that the company’s foundry business had roughly a dozen interested customers, the buildout remains costly for Intel.

76,2024-08-30,21,"MongoDB shares surge as high as 16% on guidance boost MongoDB shares jumped as much as 16% in extended trading Thursday after the database software maker reported healthy fiscal second-quarter earnings and pushed up full-year guidance.

Here’s how the company did against LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** 70 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $478.1 million vs. $464.1 million

MongoDB’s revenue grew 13% year over year in the quarter that ended July 31, according to a [statement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mongodb-inc-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results-302234446.html). The quarter’s net loss came to $54.5 million, or 74 cents per share, compared with $37.6 million, or 53 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

“We believe we are incredibly well positioned to help customers incorporate generative AI into their business and modernize their legacy application estate,” CEO Dev Ittycheria said in the statement.

The company’s Atlas cloud database service enjoyed modestly better consumption than expected, he said on a conference call with analysts.

In the fiscal first quarter, Atlas consumption growth slowed as clients observed more challenging economic conditions, and usage in the fiscal second quarter implied that the climate did not change, Ittycheria said.

“We generally have not seen the macro environment impact our ability to win new business, and that was true in Q2 as well,” Ittycheria said. “We realized that this is different from what you hear from some other software vendors.”

On Thursday Ash Kulkarni, CEO of search software maker Elastic, said the volume of client commitments it closed in its [fiscal first quarter](https://ir.elastic.co/news/news-details/2024/Elastic-Reports-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx) was below plan. That stock was down 23% after hours. During the MongoDB call, Ittycheria talked about helping companies migrate from Elastic products.

With respect to guidance, MongoDB called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 65 cents to 68 cents per share on $493.0 million to $497.0 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected 60 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $478.8 million in revenue.

Management nudged up its fiscal 2025 forecast. MongoDB now sees $2.33 to $2.47 per share in adjusted earnings, with $1.92 billion to $1.93 billion in revenue. That’s up from the May guidance of $2.15 to $2.30 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.88 billion to $1.90 billion in revenue. Analysts had predicted $2.26 per share in adjusted earnings, along with $1.90 billion in revenue.

Excluding the after-hours move, MongoDB shares were down almost 40% on the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 17% in the same period.

153,2024-08-30,38,"Alibaba shares jump after it completes three-year regulatory overhaul  Alibaba has completed a three-year regulatory “rectification” process following an antitrust fine it received on charges of monopolistic practices in 2021, China’s market regulator said on Friday.

Shares of Alibaba rose more than 3% in Friday morning trading.

On Friday, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said that, over the past few years, it has been supervising Alibaba’s process to become compliant with antitrust regulations. The rectification work has achieved “good results,” the SAMR said, according to a Google-translated statement.

In 2021, China’s SAMR fined Alibaba 18.23 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) as part of an anti-monopoly investigation into the tech giant. The regulator’s focus was on a practice that forces merchants to choose one of two e-commerce platforms, rather than being able to work with both.

At the time, the regulator said that the “choose one” policy and others allowed Alibaba to bolster its position in the market and gain unfair competitive advantages.

Since that fine, the SAMR has been supervising Alibaba as it gets in line with the regulator’s requirements. Alibaba has now completed this process and has stopped the ”‘choose one of two’ monopoly behavior,” the SAMR said Friday.

The SAMR said it will now guide Alibaba to continue to improve its compliance and efficiency and to accelerate innovation.

The conclusion of the regulatory overhaul will help put one of Alibaba’s worst run-ins with Beijing behind it. Jefferies analysts said in a note on Friday that the conclusion of the regulatory process was a “positive” for the company, which “highlights this is a new start and ensures compliance in operations.”

But the regulator’s announcement could also signal the ongoing softening stance from Chinese regulators towards private technology firms, following an intense crackdown that began at the end of 2020. At the time, Beijing enacted several regulations and moves that aimed to restrict the power of domestic technology firms in areas ranging from antitrust to gaming.

The empire of Alibaba founder Jack Ma has been in the spotlight over the past few years since regulators axed the IPO of his financial technology firm Ant Group in 2020. Ant Group itself also underwent a regulator-supervised rectification process, with most of the major issues resolved by last year.

Regulatory concerns have been an overhang on the Alibaba stock, which has fallen more than 70% from its peak in 2020. More recently, the company has been dealing with slow growth amid rising competition in the e-commerce space in China, as well as contending with a cautious Chinese consumer.

The tech titan showed early signs of a recovery in the June quarter, as cloud computing revenue reaccelerated and transactions via its e-commerce platforms looked healthy.

* FOMC focuses on PCE inflation in its quarterly economic projections and also states its longer-run inflation goal in terms of headline PCE.  PCE inflation has been preferred over CPI since 2000 for three main reasons:

1. The expenditure weights in the PCE can change as people substitute away from some goods and services for others
2. PCE includes more comprehensive coverage of goods and services
3. Historical PCE data can be revised more than for seasonal factors only

Or maybe the market messed up briefly and they saw a quick arbitrage play where the price for the stock + put < strike ?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

So for instance but not limited to, take Visa and mastercard.

Visa has had better margins than mastercard, meaning they do a better job managing their costs. On the other hand, mastercard has had better returns on asset / equity / investment. So mastercard is able to better returns with the same assets and equity.

From a long term perspective, if you had to choose just one company, which one would you choose? Also, from a financial or accounting perspective, how is it possible for a company with better margins than the other to have lower returns?"

18,2024-08-29,16,"CHWY earnings beat the catalyst to set off the pet industry stocks comeback. WOOF maybe next? During the sickness era we saw huge pet growth. That is why a lot of pet related stocks like CHWY and WOOF had such high valuations, however the past year we have seen pet ownership flat line but that does not mean it's a dud. Pet spending is still projected to grow for a while even though household ownership is expected to stay the same. According to business wire pet spending is projected to grow to **190B** by 2028

**Now let me list the good parts I see and why I think WOOF is undervalued**

Pet Humanization: Pets have gone from domestic animals to family. Dogs have gone from being outside in the dog house to sharing a bed with you. I am sure you have noticed all the cute reels and tik toks. People LOVE their pets. I LOVE MY PET. This makes it a stickier business. Honestly it was probably the pet industry's plan all along.

Pet industry is also said to have grown during the 2008 recession. Does this mean its recession proof? No clue honestly but it's a good sign.

Let's talk about some numbers.

WOOF pulls in about **6B in revenue a year** with a **market cap** of **1B**. That's a **P/S of .167**, they generate 6 times their market cap in revenue.

**Insider buying** from the board of directors back in May. They also have a **new CEO**(Joel D. Anderson) coming in that has a pretty solid track record.

I believe they are trading really low because of their profit lately and how much debt they have but after digging deeper their debt is not as bad as people think. They have been steadily paying it down and over 1B of it is capital leases.

Also if you go to a certain website it will say they had a 1.2B loss last year which is pretty misleading. It was 1.2B marked as goodwill from 2015.

WOOF is not all fine and dandy but I believe they can turn around especially with the new management coming in. I don't believe the market is fairly valuing them especially. The recent earnings beat by CHWY has also given WOOF a price rise alongside them.

Good luck on your investing journeys!"

So far i know questrade will do it over the phone but the purchase must be a minimum of $5000 USD and commission is whichever is more between 1% or $195.

edit: an example for clarity is LVMHF. in questrade they have its pink sheet or something. it doesn't include the dividends. to get the normal version with the dividends you have to order it over the phone lol with those lame requirements i said.


Edit 2: in questrade you can split up the minimum $5000 USD between multiple securities.

78,2024-08-29,35,"Deep dive into Lululemon - Outsmarting Nike and Adidas **1.0 Introduction**

At first glance, Lululemon seems like an apparel company that somehow continues to do well, despite selling overpriced products. 

However, there’s a lot more than that. I’ll argue it should be a case study in every business school, as it continues to outsmart giants like Nike and Adidas.

Lululemon has been growing its revenue at an average rate **above 20% annually** for a decade, significantly higher than Nike’s 6%, and the disappointing 3% of Adidas.

Not only is Lululemon increasing its market share, but it is significantly more profitable than its competitors.

**Last decade's operating margin:**

Nike: 13%

Adidas: 7%

Lululemon: 20%

***How is this possible?***



**2.0 Its secret formula - Ignoring the rules**

The big companies out there spend millions on celebrity endorsements. This approach brings exposure quickly but is very expensive.

**Nike** has Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, and Rafael Nadal.

**Adidas** has Lionel Messi, David Beckham, and James Harden.

**Under Armour** has Dwayne Johnson, Tom Brady, and Steph Curry.



**What about Lululemon?** Well, there’s no celebrity.

Lululemon took a different approach. Instead of paying millions to celebrities, it partners with **micro-influencers**, **yoga teachers**, and **fitness instructors**, who are largely unknown. These people live more ordinary lives and one can easily connect with them.

They’re known as “**brand ambassadors**“ and they get to host Lululemon events. In return for promoting the brand, they get:

* Free Lululemon apparel;
* Priority access to new products; and
* Featured on Lululemon’s social media and website, which generates more traffic for them and helps them build/grow their business and audience.

Nike spends 9% of its revenue on marketing, Adidas spends 11%, and Lululemon spends less than **5%!**

Not only this approach is cheaper, but it also allows for thousands of communities to be formed, that are likely to stay together. The outcome is clear: **Stronger, deeper, emotional relationships are formed**, that are not purely transactional.

This is the company’s **MOAT** - Creating a cult-like following.

In addition, there are larger outdoor events, 10k runs, sweat games, etc.



**3.0 Too Expensive Products - So What?**

The company’s products are **significantly more expensive** than the competition. They capitalized on the increase in demand for athletic, stylish, yet versatile clothing that eventually became known as “**athleisure**“.

There is no doubt that the products come with exceptional quality, thanks to a combination of innovative fabrics and superior design. In addition, there is free hemming that comes with a Lululemon membership. This service ensures that the product purchased fits the customer.

Combining all of this, with the community aspect above, allows the company to charge a premium price for its products.

The two main competitors in the U.S. are now **Alo Yoga** and **Vuori** and there are plenty of copycats. This is being perceived as the biggest risk, yet, the company continues to grow and deliver.

**Is the demand for its products going to decrease?**

History has taught us that there will be demand for premium brands, especially in the fashion industry. From Dior and Louis Vuitton to Rolex and Balenciaga, all of them face copycats. Yet, they are still around and doing well.

For that reason, I do believe Lululemon will continue to grow in the years to come, especially given the fact that the company’s international expansion has just started (\~80% of the revenue comes from the Americas).

In addition, the younger generations have a more favorable view of Lululemon. The company will only benefit from this trend over time.

  
**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**

Over the last twelve months, the company's revenue was almost $10b, with an operating margin of 22%.

As mentioned at the very beginning, the company’s margins are significantly above its competitors. There are two main reasons for that:

1. **Advertising** - which was already covered above
2. **Selling directly to consumers** - Over 90**%** of all the sales are online, or through the company-operated stores. This means in most cases, there is **no 3rd party in between collecting a fee**.

As the company is profitable and generates lots of free cash flow, it is worth having a look at the other side of the equation. Where does the cash go?

1. **Capex** - In order to grow, the company has to reinvest in opening new stores.
2. **Share buybacks** - The number of shares outstanding is down \~10% over the last decade.

  
**5.0 Past Mistakes**

Before I move to the topic of valuation, two management decisions can be labeled as mistakes:

1. In June 2020, Lululemon acquired Mirror for \~$500m. Fast forward to Q4-2022, and the business has now almost been entirely written off. The in-house fitness company that created an interactive workout platform featuring live and on-demand classes did not do as well as expected post the pandemic.
2. The share price of the company went up significantly on a few occasions, and the management decided to continue buying back shares. I do think above a certain point, share buybacks destroy shareholders’ value, and this point has been crossed way too many times.

  
**6.0 Valuation**

My assumptions are as follows:

**Revenue**: To double over the next decade (\~7% annualized growth)

**Operating margin:** To remain at the current level of 22%.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $33.6b **($269/share)**, not that far from today’s share price of $259.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:

|Revenue / Operating margin|20%|22%|24%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|75% ($17.5b)|$217|$242|$266|
|102% ($20.2b)|$241|$269|$297|
|125% ($22.5b)|$263|$294|$325|

57,2024-08-29,24,"Ulta misses expectations, trims guidance after quarterly sales decline  Ulta Beauty shares fell 7% in extended trading Thursday as the company fell short of second-quarter expectations and trimmed its full-year guidance after a decline in same-store sales during the most recent period.

It was the company’s first earnings per share miss since May 2020 and first revenue miss since December 2020.

Comparable sales for the second quarter fell 1.2%, compared with an 8% increase a year earlier and well below the 1.2% growth that Wall Street analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.

“While we are encouraged by many positive indicators across our business, our second quarter performance did not meet our expectations, driven primarily by a decline in comparable store sales. We are clear about the factors that adversely impacted our store performance, and we have actions underway to address the trends,” CEO Dave Kimbell said a press release.

The company now forecasts full-year same-store sales in a range of flat to 2% down, compared with prior guidance of 2% to 3% growth.

“Our updated outlook for sales assumes it will take more time for our actions to change the top line trajectory and that stores impacted by multiple competitive openings will continue to be pressured,” CFO Paula Oyibo said.

Ulta also now expects full-year revenue of $11 billion to $11.2 billion, down from previous guidance of $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion, and full-year earnings per share of $22.60 to $23.50, down from a previous forecast of $25.20 to $26.

Here’s how the beauty retailer performed in the period ended August 3 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $5.30 vs. $5.46 expected

Revenue: $2.55 billion vs. $2.61 billion expected

The company reported net income of $252.6 million, or $5.30 per share, compared with $300.1 million, or $6.02 per share, during the same quarter a year earlier. 

Revenue rose to $2.55 billion, up from $2.53 billion a year earlier.

Earlier this month, Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a $266 million stake in the beauty retailer, sending Ulta shares surging. For some analysts, it was validation that the stock was oversold after falling 32% in 2024 up to that point, tumbling 26% in the second quarter alone.

Shares of Ulta have been suffering since CEO Dave Kimbell warned of cooling beauty demand at an investor conference back in April. Kimbell said although a pullback was expected, it had hit the company “a bit earlier and bit bigger” than anticipated.

During the company’s first-quarter earnings call in May, Kimbell outlined plans to boost sales that spanned five key areas: product assortment, brand social relevance, enhancing the consumer digital experience, boosting the loyalty program and evolving the company’s promotional levers.

In the same call, Kimbell also said the beauty retailer later this year would be expanding its partnership with delivery service DoorDash, would start testing new gamification platforms and would activate new marketing technology to personalize customer shopping experience.

420,2024-08-29,72,"Dell beats estimates as server sales soar 80%, riding AI wave  Dell reported quarterly results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, powered by an 80% increase in server sales. The stock rose more than 5% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did for the fiscal second quarter vs. LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: $25.06 billion vs. $24.53 billion expected

EPS: $1.89 adjusted, vs. $1.71 expected

Net income climbed 85% to $841 million, or $1.17 per share, from $455 million, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased about 9% from $22.93 billion a year ago.

Dell typically provides investors with a forecast on its analyst call. Earlier this year, the company told investors to expect revenue between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion for the full year, up from $88.4 billion in the prior year.

Dell has emerged as a top vendor for servers that can handle artificial intelligence workloads, especially those based around Nvidia chips, as demand skyrockets from cloud providers. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called out Dell founder Michael Dell as the person to contact to place orders for systems that include the company’s new chips.

Dell shares are up 48% so far this year, but have slumped 34% since the company’s last report.

AI sales are in the company’s Infrastructure Solutions Group, which makes servers and systems for data centers. It’s the company’s fastest-growing unit. Overall ISG sales rose 38% to $11.65 billion, ahead of StreetAccount expectations of $10.44 billion.

The standout in Dell’s report was Servers and Networking revenue, which includes both AI-oriented servers based around GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, as well as more traditional servers for older applications. It’s part of ISG.

The unit reported $7.76 billion in sales, rising 80% on an annual basis, and beating StreetAccount expectations of $6.37 billion. Dell said $3.1 billion of that was AI server sales, up from $1.7 billion in the May quarter.

Dell operating chief Jeff Clarke attributed the increase in revenue to server demand that continues to rise, and said in a statement that there was an increasing “backlog” of $3.8 billion in AI server orders that haven’t been fulfilled yet. There’s also a multibillion-dollar “pipeline” of AI server deals from enterprises and cloud providers that haven’t been finalized.

However, Dell’s storage business, also part of ISG, fell 5% to $4 billion in sales.

Dell’s Client Solutions Group, which focuses on PCs and laptops, declined 4% on an annual basis to $12.41 billion in revenue. Consumer sales fell 22% to $1.86 billion, and the company’s enterprise PC business was flat at $10.55 billion in sales.

Dell said that it spent $1 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.

INTC seems like its down in the dumps at the moment, and doesn't have any sign of immanent revival. Where do you guys see this company and stock in the next 5 - 10 years? The stock is valued at $20 at the moment of writing, I'm just wondering if this is the time to jump into INTC since they are starting to invest in GPUs and I see them trailing behind NVDA in the next 5 years. Perhaps getting into data centres and the consumer market.

If they get their act together, this could be their ""Nvidia"" moment where they start pulling up again. Being backed by the US government means that they don't want it to fail. If Taiwan is invaded there will be massive pressure on INTC's fabricators. We have seen this once before with AMD stock falling to $2 a share, where it now sits at $145.

352,2024-08-29,73,"Lululemon cuts guidance, misses sales estimates after botched product launch Lululemon missed Wall Street’s fiscal second-quarter sales expectations and lowered its guidance Thursday after it botched a highly anticipated product launch and growth slowed in the Americas. 

The company now expects full year net revenue to be between $10.38 and $10.48 billion, down from a previous range of between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. Lululemon anticipates earnings per share will be in a range of $13.95 to $14.15, down from previous guidance of $14.27 to $14.47.

Here’s how company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $3.15 vs. $2.93 expected

Revenue: $2.37 billion vs. $2.41 billion expected

Shares dropped as much as 10% in extended trading.

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended July 28 was $393 million, or $3.15 per share, compared with $342 million, or $2.68 per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $2.37 billion, up about 7% from $2.21 billion a year earlier. Beyond total sales, Lululemon also missed expectations on comparable sales, which grew 2%, well behind estimates of 5.9%, according to StreetAccount.

During the quarter, Lululemon pulled its Breezethrough leggings, launched in early July, after it received a wave of complaints about the product’s unflattering fit. The botched launch came after the company struggled with a number of other self-inflicted issues with its assortment, including not having the right colors and sizes that its core customers desired.

The flops have contributed to a slowdown in the company’s largest market, the Americas. During the quarter, sales grew only 1% in the region.

Sales jumped 29% in Lululemon’s international markets as the company looks to China for growth.

67,2024-08-29,34,"Affirm shares surge 34% and head for best day in three years after earnings beat  Affirm shares soared 34% on Thursday and were on pace for their best day in almost three years, after the provider of buy now, pay later loans beat on the top and bottom lines in its earnings report.

If the rally holds, it will be the third-biggest rally for the stock since the company’s IPO in January 2021. The stock was trading at $42.17 as of early afternoon.

Following the market close on Wednesday, Affirm said revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter climbed 48% from a year earlier to $659 million, and that its net loss narrowed to $45.1 million from $206 million in the same period a year ago. The company beat estimates for revenue and reported a narrower-than-expected loss.

For the current quarter, Affirm sees revenue in the range of $640 million and $670 million. Analysts polled by LSEG called for revenue of $625 million.

Affirm CEO Max Levchin said in a note to shareholders that the company set a new goal of hitting operating profitability on a GAAP basis by the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025.

Analysts for Mizuho called it a “killer quarter” for Affirm in a note on Thursday, and said the “prospect of turning GAAP operating income-positive” will be “a major milestone.”

Even after Thursday’s rally, Affirm shares are still down about 14% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up 18%. But the stock has been trending higher lately, up 50% in August. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled Friday that lower interest rates could be coming as soon as September.

Bank of America analysts said in a note last month that rate cuts would be beneficial to Affirm’s funding costs and for gain on loan sales. The company moved its merchants to a 36% APR cap on loans, up from 30% previously, and analysts said this “should remain a tailwind for yields and GMV growth.”

Mizuho projects that a new Apple Pay partnership could add $12 billion to Affirm’s total addressable market once it goes live later this year.

19,2024-08-29,4,"Gap beats earnings and revenue estimates, hikes profit margin outlook  Gap beat quarterly earnings and revenue estimates and raised its full-year profit margin outlook, the apparel retailer said in results released earlier than expected Thursday.

The company’s shares rose nearly 3% after being halted for much of Thursday morning. Bloomberg reported that a presentation showing the results briefly appeared on Gap’s website in the morning, before it was apparently taken down.

Gap’s stock was halted just before 10 a.m. ET. The company then released its quarterly results at 11:12 a.m. ET, hours before it was originally expected to drop the results after the bell Thursday.

Gap did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Here’s what the company reported for the second quarter, compared with what Wall Street expected, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 54 cents vs. 40 cents expected

Revenue: $3.72 billion vs. $3.63 billion expected

The apparel retailer’s sales climbed 5% to $3.7 billion in its second quarter. Comparable sales rose 3%.

Gap posted net income of $206 million, or 54 cents per share, for the period ending Aug. 3. That compares with $117 million, or 32 cents per share, in the prior-year period.

The retailer also affirmed its full-year sales guidance of up slightly from the previous year. Gap increased its gross margin outlook to about a 200 basis point expansion, up from at least a 150 basis point expansion. It also hiked its operating income guidance to approximately 50% growth, up from percentage growth in the mid-40s.

Comparable sales were strongest at the Old Navy brand, where they rose 5%. Gap’s namesake brand posted 3% comparable sales growth.

Comparable sales were flat at Banana Republic, while they fell 4% at Athleta.

Gap’s earnings come as CEO Richard Dickson, who took the helm last year, tries to lead a sales turnaround at the legacy retailer.

Investors are watching a jammed week of retail earnings for signs of whether consumer spending is slowing down in the second half of the year. Dollar General shares plummeted on Thursday morning after the discount retailer slashed its sales and profit outlook, citing in part “financially constrained” lower-income consumers.

Both American Eagle Outfitters and Best Buy showed progress in boosting profits when they reported earnings Thursday. But the apparel retailer gave a muted outlook for its second half, while the electronics giant is still working to return to sales growth.

Lululemon and Ulta Beauty are also due to post results after the bell Thursday.

139,2024-08-29,27,"American Eagle saw profits grow nearly 60% as costs come down  American Eagle missed Wall Street’s sales targets for a second quarter in a row on Thursday, but profits grew by nearly 60% thanks in part to lower product costs. 

Shares fell more than 5% in premarket trading Thursday.

Here’s how the apparel company did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 39 cents vs. 38 cents expected 

Revenue: $1.29 billion vs. $1.31 billion expected 

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 was $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, compared with $48.6 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $1.29 billion, up about 8% from $1.2 billion a year earlier. That sales gain would have been slimmer had it not been for a calendar shift, which positively impacted second-quarter sales by $55 million.

During the quarter, American Eagle’s intimates line Aerie saw revenue grow 9% while its namesake brand grew by 8%. 

American Eagle’s gross margin came in at 38.6% — 0.9 percentage points higher than the prior year and in line with what analysts had expected. The gross margin expansion was led by “favorable product costs,” indicating American Eagle spent less to make its assortment during the quarter. It’s unclear if it lowered prices as a result.

The longtime mall brand issued a better-than-expected outlook for the current quarter but its forecast was lower than anticipated for the full year, indicating the company is still bracing for a turbulent second half. 

For the current quarter, American Eagle expects comparable sales to grow between 3% and 4%, which is better than the 2.8% growth that analysts had expected the company to forecast, according to StreetAccount. 

The retailer is expecting total revenue to be flat to up slightly for the third quarter — in line with expectations, according to LSEG.

For the year, the company expects comparable sales to increase approximately 4%, with total revenue up 2% to 3%, shy of what analysts had expected. Wall Street was expecting its full-year comparable sales forecast to be up 4.2% and overall sales to be up 3.5%, according to StreetAccount and LSEG.

In May, Finance Chief Mike Mathias told CNBC that American Eagle is maintaining a “cautious” view for the back half of the year as it awaits interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve and prepares for “noise” around the upcoming presidential election. 

Like other retailers contending with slowing demand for discretionary items, American Eagle has looked to cut costs and boost efficiencies so it can protect profits, even if sales are sluggish. Earlier this year, it unveiled a new strategy to grow profits and is working to boost sales by 3% to 5% each year over the next three years and get its operating margin to about 10%.

During the quarter, American Eagle made some strides in achieving that goal. It posted an operating income of $101 million, an increase of 55%, while its operating margin grew 2.4 percentage points to 7.8%. Operating income would have been lower had it not been for the calendar shift, which positively impacted the metric by $20 million.

35,2024-08-29,7,"Best Buy shares jump on profit beat and guidance hike  Best Buy raised its fiscal-year profit guidance Thursday after exceeding earnings and revenue expectations for the most recent quarter.

The retailer now expects to see full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.10 to $6.35, up from a prior range of $5.75 to $6.20. The company, however, lowered the top end of its guidance ranges for both full-year revenue and comparable sales.

“As we look to the back half of the year, we expect our industry to continue to show increasing stabilization,” Best Buy CFO Matt Bilunas said in the company’s press release.

Shares of Best Buy jumped more than 14% in premarket trading Thursday.

Here’s how the consumer electronics retailer did for the period ended August 3 compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.34 vs. $1.16 expected

Revenue: $9.29 billion vs. $9.24 billion expected

The company reported net income for the quarter of $291 million, or $1.34 per share, compared with $274 million, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier. 

Net sales in the quarter dropped to $9.29 billion from $9.58 billion during the same period a year earlier.

Comparable sales declined 2.3% during the quarter, compared with a 6.2% decline a year earlier.

Best Buy has been in the midst of an attempted turnaround in response to a two-year sales slump. Discretionary merchandise retailers across the board have struggled with softer consumer demand in the wake of unusually high sales throughout the Covid pandemic and as consumers pullback due to high inflation.

As the much-awaited replacement cycle of pandemic-era tech purchases starts trickling in, the retailer is hoping to cash in through marketing and operational initiatives. Best Buy said in July that it would add trained sales teams to three key parts of its stores — computing, appliance, and home theater — and kick off a marketing campaign that includes YouTube videos to draw consumer interest.

The company was also betting on a wave of new tech gadget debuts, such as a collection of new iPads launched by Apple in May and artificial intelligence-enabled laptops touted by Microsoft, to drive sales.

The company on Thursday posted comparable sales growth of 6% in the domestic tablet and computing categories. However, that was “more than offset” by declines in appliances, home theater and gaming, executives said.

“We capitalized on demand driven by our customers’ desire to replace or upgrade their products, combined with new innovation,” CEO Corie Barry said during the company’s earnings call. “We see a consumer who is seeking value in sales events and one who is also willing to spend on high-price-point products when they need to or when there is new, compelling technology.”

Barry said AI could continue to boost sales across categories over the next few years.

“We believe we are just at the beginning of the impact of AI on tech innovation and customer demand,” she said.

> **Nvidia** — The chip designer and artificial intelligence bellwether slipped more than 4% despite surpassing Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom line in its fiscal second quarter. Nvidia earned 68 cents per share on revenue of $30.04 billion, while analysts polled by LSEG forecast 64 cents and $28.7 billion. The company’s third-quarter revenue outlook, which would represent 80% growth compared to the same period a year ago, failed to meet the higher end of investor’s expectations and would mark a slowdown vs the July quarter.

118,2024-08-29,44,"10-2 year treasury yield curve first time positive since 5th July 2022 In advance: I know that predicting the market is impossible. Just want to point out that (almost) every single time the 10-2 year yield curve went negative (for example 1980, 1982, 2001, 2008, ""2020"") a recession occured after it showed an positive upwards trend. Of course the market changes and, as mentioned, is unpredictable. Maybe everything goes smoothly and nothing happens, maybe not. From my point of perspective Americas macroeconomics are a little worrying in some areas, but only time will tell.

Nonetheless, what's your view on this? Don't care and carry on, or is there more behind it? I won't neccessarily change my trading strategy, but I might reduce my overall investment per week so I get to spend more during lower prices.

55,2024-08-28,20,"CrowdStrike beats quarterly consensus but lowers full-year guidance CrowdStrike shares rose 4% in extended trading on Wednesday after the cybersecurity software maker reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but reduced full-year guidance in the wake of a global outage.

Here is how the company did compared to LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $1.04 adjusted vs. 97 cents expected

Revenue: $963.9 million vs. $959 million expected

CrowdStrike’s revenue grew 32% year over year in the quarter, which ended on July 31, according to a statement. The company recorded net income of $47 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with $8.47 million, or 3 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

Annual recurring revenue was $3.86 billion, just above the StreetAccount consensus of $3.85 billion.

On July 19, CrowdStrike distributed a flawed content configuration update for its Falcon sensor to computers running Microsoft
 Windows operating systems, with the intent to gather data on new attacks. The error caused millions of computers to crash, leading to flight cancelations, delayed packaged deliveries and postponed medical appointments. Administrators had to manually reboot affected computers.

CEO George Kurtz apologized to clients and partners and said the company had rolled out a fix. Meanwhile, investors were pushing down CrowdStrike’s share price. Shareholders have filed suit against the company, and Delta Air Lines
, which cited $380 million in lost revenue and $170 million in costs because of the incident, said it will seek damages. Travelers have filed class-action suits against the CrowdStrike as well.

“All customers are looking for some kind of discount,” Gray Powell and Trevor Rambo of BTIG, with the equivalent of a hold rating on CrowdStrike shares, wrote in an Aug. 23 note.

With respect to guidance, CrowdStrike called for adjusted net earnings of 80 cents to 81 cents per share on $979.2 million to $984.7 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for 96 cents in adjusted net earnings per share on $1.01 billion in revenue.

For the 2025 fiscal year, CrowdStrike now sees $3.61 to $3.65 in adjusted earnings per share and $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion in revenue. That’s down from management’s June forecast for adjusted earnings per share of $3.93 to $4.03 and revenue between $3.98 billion to $4.01 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected adjusted profit of $3.88 per share, with $3.95 billion in revenue.

The full-year revenue guidance includes a negative subscription revenue impact of $30 million in each quarter and professional services revenue in the high-single-digit millions of dollars for the second half of the fiscal year, because of incentives for a customer commitment package, according to the statement. The adjusted guidance excludes costs related to the outage, CrowdStrike said.

Before CrowdStrike issued the earnings report, its stock was up about 4% this year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 17% over that period.

2462,2024-08-28,605,"Nvidia reports 122% revenue growth on surging demand for data center chips Nvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and guidance, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Nvidia shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading.

Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted versus 64 cents per share expected by LSEG.

Revenue: $30.04 billion versus $28.7 billion expected by LSEG.

Nvidia said it expected about $32.5 billion in current quarter revenue, versus $31.77 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Nvidia is the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Its market value has expanded more than nine times since the end of 2022 and was up 34% since the company’s last earnings report.

88,2024-08-28,26,"Salesforce beats earnings estimates, president and CFO Amy Weaver to step down Salesforce shares rose about 1.5% in extended trading on Wednesday after the business software maker reported robust fiscal second-quarter results that beat estimates and raised its full-year profit outlook.

The company also announced president and CFO Amy Weaver will step down. She will remain at the company as the CFO until a successor is appointed and, after that, will stay on as an advisor.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $$2.56 adjusted vs. $2.36 expected

Revenue: $9.33 billion vs. $9.23 billion expected

The company’s revenue grew 8% year over year during the quarter, which ended on July 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $1.43 billion, or $1.47 per share, was up from $1.27 billion, or $1.28 per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

With respect to guidance, Salesforce called for adjusted fiscal third-quarter earnings of $2.42 to $2.44 per share on $9.21 to $9.36 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected $2.43 in earnings per share on $9.41 billion in revenue.

Management called for $10.03 to $10.11 per share in adjusted fiscal 2025 earnings, with $6.05 billion to $6.13 billion in revenue. Last quarter’s forecast was $9.86 to $9.94 per share and revenue from $37.7 billion to $38.0 billion. The LSEG consensus was $9.89 in adjusted earnings per share, with $37.84 billion in revenue.

During the quarter, Salesforce said in the fall it will start testing an Einstein Copilot for Merchants that can compose product pages and promotions with a few words of human input.

Earlier this month, activist investors Starboard and ValueAct both disclosed increases in their Salesforce positions. Both bought shares before the company announced a widening of its adjusted operating margin sooner than planned last year.

Excluding the after-hours move, Salesforce shares are down 2% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 index has gained 17% over the same period.

9,2024-08-28,34,"Thoughts on CAVA? No position, but since I saw the share price recently, I decided to get lunch there on Sunday. Paid $13 for some chicken and rice bowl and signed up for the rewards program. I love Chipotle and I frequently hear about CAVA being the next Chipotle. A few points:

1. The bowl was good but I'm not sure if it's worth an extra $2 to $3 over my sofritas bowl that I usually get at Chipotle. In my city, a Chipotle bowl goes for about $10 to $11. 
2. I don't like CAVA's rewards program. Points expire within 4 months, and you need at least 880 points to redeem said points for a discount. You basically need to eat there at least once or twice a month for the rewards to be worth it. Meanwhile, at Chipotle, you only need to eat there once every six months to keep your reward points active and you can more easily hoard them for an entree. 

The stock is also much more expensive than Chipotle. They are priced in, I think. I'll have CAVA on occasion but I think I'll stick with Chipotle when I'm out and about and want something substantial and familiar."
0,2024-08-28,14,"Is it better to invest in the entire market or wait to buy in ETFs for certain sectors? I've been told and have read in countless investing and stock market books to buy the entire market using VOO and SCHD and that is all I need to do. Just literally every paycheck or every whenever put in as much as I can and keep buying. If the ultimate goal is to make money with as little risk of possible this may in fact be the way. However is it not better to buy not every paycheck or month but instead buy only when the market is down say 8% for the week? We have those weeks at least 3X a year it seems and that might be the way. The only counter to this is that if you are in a bull market and wait for the 8% dip you will eventually get the 8% dip. It may be after the market has ran up 20% though so you lost out of those gains. 

Is it better to invest in VOO and SCHD or is it better to buy up sector ETFs? Say energy is the worst performer of the last 18 months. It is bound to start going up again, right? So why not invest instead of in VOO or SCHD but instead only in ETFs looking at sectors when they are not performing well since almost all sectors do well over the mid and all do well over the long run. The only counter I see to this again like above is you may be missing out by not being in the market long enough. If you instead just invest in VOO and SCHD you will come out ahead unless we have a major recession or even depression (and at that point I'm stocking up on canned goods and buying shelter equipment). If you wait until say energy is down to the worst performing sectors then you will loose out by not being equally in all areas of the market... So long story short I think the answer is to just buy VOO and SCHD and go from there. I don't even recommend buying individual stocks anymore tbh. The only exception to this is AST Spacemobile bc I see ASTS going up another 200% over the next year and that could make $10k turn into $20k+ very quick. I also believe NVDA is going to keep going over the next 3 years. Heck even if we somehow have a recession I think NVDA by late 2027 will easily be 2X from where it is right now. People saying to back off it right now are crazy. "
31,2024-08-28,2,"Foot Locker shares drop 12% despite first comparable sales growth in six quarters  Foot Locker on Wednesday said comparable sales grew for the first time in six quarters as its efforts to refresh its stores and improve the customer experience continue to bear fruit. 

The beleaguered sneaker company’s same-store sales grew 2.6% during its fiscal second quarter, far better than the 0.7% uptick that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Its gross margin also expanded for the first time in more than two years. 

Despite the positive trends, the company’s shares dropped about 12% in early trading.

“The Lace Up Plan is working,” CEO Mary Dillon said in a press release, referencing the company’s turnaround strategy. “Our top line trends strengthened as we moved through the quarter, including a solid start to Back-to-School. We were also particularly pleased to deliver stabilization in our Champs Sports banner.” 

Here’s how Foot Locker did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Loss per share: 5 cents adjusted vs. 7 cents expected 

Revenue: $1.90 billion vs. $1.89 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Aug. 3, Foot Locker had a loss of $12 million, or 13 cents per share, compared with a loss of $5 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Foot Locker posted a loss of 5 cents per share. 

Sales rose to $1.90 billion, up about 2% from $1.86 billion a year earlier. 

For the current fiscal year, Foot Locker largely maintained its guidance and continues to expect sales to be in a range of a 1% decline to 1% growth from the prior year – better than the 0.4% decline that analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Foot Locker also stood by its adjusted earnings per share guidance. It expects earnings to be between $1.50 and $1.70 – much of that range ahead of the $1.54 that analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Since former Ulta Beauty boss Mary Dillon took the helm of Foot Locker about two years ago, she has worked to transform the company and ensure that it stays relevant in a world where brands aren’t as reliant on multibrand retailers as they were in the past. 

Dillon has worked to repair the company’s relationship with its biggest brand partner, Nike, and has also taken a hard look at its sprawling, but aging, store fleet, where the company does about 80% of its sales. The company plans to spend $275 million upgrading its stores this year, and it expects to have two-thirds of its fleet remodeled by the end of fiscal 2025.

In an interview with CNBC, Dillon said the store investments are leading to increased conversion, basket size and profitability, and better performance for Foot Locker’s women’s business.

“The reason that we’re doing it is that it is working for us, both in terms of enhancing a customer experience and a striper [store employee] experience, but also the financial returns,” said Dillon. “The performance is ahead of what we thought.”

In a series of new megastores Foot Locker is building in hotspots like New York City and Paris, the retailer is working hand in hand with Nike to develop some portions of the shops.

“With Nike, this has been since Day One, a high priority for me, and really building a partnership that isn’t just about like, what number of shoes are we going to sell, but how do we think about using consumer insights to mutually grow our businesses together,” said Dillon. “For us and Nike, it’s about the places that we really connect.”

Dillon has also worked to streamline costs at Foot Locker. On Wednesday, the company said it was closing its stores and e-commerce operations in South Korea, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and will rely on a third party for operations in Greece and Romania, where it plans to expand its reach, according to Dillon. In all, 30 of Foot Locker’s 140 stores in the Asia-Pacific region and 629 in Europe will be closed or go under a new operator as part of the changes. 

Foot Locker’s Champs banner, which has been dragging down the company’s overall performance, is also showing some signs of improvement. During the quarter, comparable sales were down 3.9%, which is an improvement from the 25.3% decline it saw in the year-ago period.

Foot Locker is also planning to move its global headquarters from New York City to St. Petersburg, Florida, in late 2025 and plans to maintain only a limited presence in the Big Apple moving forward. 

“The intent of the relocation is to further build on the Company’s meaningful presence in St. Petersburg and to enable increased collaboration among teams across banners and functions, while also reducing costs,” Foot Locker said in a news release. 

Dillon told CNBC the move will increase margins by 0.2 percentage point by 2027, but the decision wasn’t just based on saving money.

“We’ve got a big center of gravity already in St. Pete ... many of our executives are there. A lot of our commercial teams,” said Dillon. “We think actually bringing more people together for collaboration is going to matter and that’s also part of this. It’s not just about saving money. It’s about, how do we really continue to build on this momentum?”

The company isn’t planning to make employees relocate and Dillon, who is based in Chicago, won’t be forced to become a super commuter, either.

“I am traveling, I would say, 90% of the time, to our teams around the world, and to our brand partners, and to investor meetings and to events,” said Dillon. “I spend a good chunk of time in New York, I spend a lot of time in St. Pete, I spend a lot of time in Amsterdam where we have our headquarters, and visiting our brand partners. So I’m planning to keep my primary residence in Chicago, but the way that this has been working is really, I think, working pretty well so we’re going to continue to do that.”

As it improves stores, products, and the customer experience online and in stores, Foot Locker is managing to drive sales even as its core consumer continues to feel the pressure of consistent inflation and high interest rates – indicating that Dillon’s efforts are working. 

“We’re not expecting our customer to get, like, less pressured or more pressured. We’re just trying to say this is a category they care about,” said Dillon. “How can Foot Locker be the best to serve their needs? And I think our results are showing that that’s working.”

As of Tuesday’s close, shares of the company are up more than 5% this year, compared with Nike’s stock, which has fallen more than 21% in the same time period.

Demand has undoubtedly slowed across the retail industry, but consumers are still spending. They’re just being far choosier on who they’re spending with — which has made execution that much more important. 

“Our strategies are building momentum as we look to the remainder of the year,” said Dillon in a statement. “I remain confident that we are taking the right actions to position the Company for its next 50 years of profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.”

57,2024-08-28,21,"Abercrombie & Fitch posts 21% sales gain, hikes outlook in 'uncertain environment'  Abercrombie & Fitch’s revenue grew 21% during its fiscal second quarter as the apparel company builds on its torrid growth. 

The sales gain, which follows 16% growth in the year-ago period, led the company to issue bullish guidance for the current quarter. Still, its full-year outlook was largely in line with estimates as it prepares for one fewer week this year than last. 

CEO Fran Horowitz – who often says good companies win in any economic environment – may be bracing for a turbulent second half of the year because for the first time in four quarters, she referenced the uncertain state of the economy in the company’s earnings release.

“We delivered a strong first half of the year, and we are increasing our full-year outlook. Although we continue to operate in an increasingly uncertain environment, we remain steadfast in executing our global playbook and maintaining discipline over inventory and expenses,” said Horowitz. “We are on track and confident in our goal to deliver sustainable, profitable growth this year, while making strategic long-term investments across marketing, digital and technology and stores to enable future growth.”

The company’s shares — which were up nearly 89% this year as of Tuesday’s close — fell about 15% in early trading.

Here’s how Abercrombie did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $2.50 vs. $2.22 expected

Revenue: $1.13 billion vs. $1.10 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 was $133 million, or $2.50 per share, compared with $57 million, or $1.10 per share, a year earlier.  

Sales rose to $1.13 billion, up about 21% from $935 million a year earlier. 

During the quarter, same-store sales jumped 18%, driven by better-than-expected summer and back-to-school selling. 

For the current quarter, Abercrombie expects sales to rise by a low double-digit percentage, better than the 8.9% growth that LSEG analysts had expected. 

Abercrombie raised its full-year sales guidance from 10% growth to a 12% to 13% increase, which is roughly in line with the 12% rise that LSEG analysts had expected. 

The company’s fiscal 2024 will have one fewer week than fiscal 2023, which is likely weighing on its full-year guidance. Abercrombie expects the loss of one selling week will have an $80 million impact on its holiday quarter, or 5.5 percentage points. For the full year, the company expects it to hit sales by $50 million, or 1.2 percentage points. 

Over the last year, Abercrombie has become known as retail’s biggest comeback story, and investors have been watching to see if the company can keep up its growth. 

Horowitz has looked to international markets and the company’s Hollister and Abercrombie Kids brands as growth vectors, which are already boosting sales. 

During the quarter, sales at Hollister jumped 17% while comparable sales rose 15%. In the company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa division, sales climbed 16%. 

Costly international expansion was one of the missteps that weighed on Abercrombie’s performance in the past, but the company is taking a different approach this time around.

Earlier this month, it announced a partnership with Haddad Brands – a licensor of children’s wear – to create new distribution channels for Abercrombie Kids and grow the product line to include infant and toddler categories. 

“As we work to diversify A&F Co.’s channel mix and drive sustainable, profitable growth, we are thrilled to partner with Haddad Brands to build on our success and create an opportunity to grow the brand in the years ahead by engaging with new customers globally,” Horowitz said in a statement at the time. 

Products from Abercrombie Kids are set to be available in Haddad Brands’ showrooms globally next month.

Are Trump fanatics really enough to stop this garbage stock pretty much going to zero? Or am I missing something here because it seems like an obvious strong sell."
1371,2024-08-28,259,"Trump Media stock falls below $20 per share, a first since company went public  The monthslong Trump Media stock slide continued Wednesday, as shares of the company majority-owned by former President Donald Trump fell below $20 for the first time since the Truth Social maker went public in March of this year.

As of 12:45 p.m. ET, the stock price of DJT has dropped more than 75% from its intraday high on March 26, the day the company debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Trump Media has also lost more than half its value since its recent surge on July 15, the first trading day after the Republican presidential nominee narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.

A Trump Media spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on the stock’s latest dive.

Trump owns nearly 59% of Trump Media’s stock. Even after losing much of its value, Trump’s stake at Wednesday’s stock price is still worth more than $2.2 billion — more than half of his on-paper net worth, according to Forbes.

Trump, and other company executives and insiders, are bound by lock-up agreements that have so far barred them from cashing in on their shares.

But the lock-ups are set to expire as soon as Sept. 20, at which point Trump may choose to start selling his shares.

Trump has given no indication that he plans to cash out once he is able to do so. But speculation has flared that he might, especially as Trump Media’s latest earnings reports show it losing millions of dollars and generating little revenue.

If he does sell — or if he even appears likely to — investors could lose confidence in Trump Media, a situation the company’s own regulatory filings have acknowledged.

Similar to other meme stocks, investing in Trump Media has come to be seen as a way for Trump’s supporters to back him and bet on his chances of beating Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election.

But the company has noted that its fledgling social media platform, Truth Social, depends at least partly on Trump’s enduring popularity and reputation. Trump, who holds the most popular Truth Social account, has recently started posting more on X, his former messaging app of choice, and TikTok.

The stock’s recent slide has also coincided with Trump’s shifting political and legal circumstances. Trump’s odds of winning the election appear to have narrowed after President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid and endorsed Harris as his successor.

Trump Media also announced last month that it had entered into an agreement with investment firm Yorkville Advisors, which could enable the company to issue up to $2.5 billion in stock to Yorkville.

The deal would “guarantee access to additional capital, if necessary, to pursue big strategic opportunities as we look to build out our portfolio by acquiring assets and technologies in the Patriot economy,” Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a July 3 press release.

The company noted in a separate regulatory filing, “The sale and issuance of Shares to Yorkville will cause dilution to our existing shareholders, and the sale of Shares acquired by Yorkville, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our Common Stock to fall.”

608,2024-08-28,70,"Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway hits $1 trillion market value  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first non-technology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone.

Shares of the Omaha-based conglomerate have rallied more than 27% in 2024, nearly doubling the S&P 500′s return. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ turns 94 years old.

The shares were up 1.2% on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet.

Unlike the six other companies in the trillion dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen. (Although its sizable Apple position has helped drive recent gains.)

Buffett took control of Berkshire, a struggling textile business, in the 1960s and transformed the company into a sprawling empire that encompasses insurance, railroad, retail and energy with an unmatched balance sheet and cash fortress.

Buffett has been in a defensive mode as of late, dumping a massive amount of stock, including half of his Apple stake, while raising Berkshire’s cash pile to a record $277 billion at the end of June.

While Buffett famously never times the market and advises others to not try to either, these recent moves served as a wake-up call to some of his followers on Wall Street, who believe he saw some things he did not like about the economy and market valuation.

Berkshire invests the majority of its cash in short-term Treasury bills, and its holding in such securities — valued at $234.6 billion at the end of the second quarter — has exceeded the amount the U.S. Federal Reserve owns.

High price tag

Berkshire’s original Class A shares carry one of the highest price tags on Wall Street. Today, each one sells for 68% more than the median price of a home in the U.S. 

That’s because Buffett has never split the stock, arguing that the high share price attracts and retains more long-term, quality-oriented investors. The Ben Graham protégé has said that many Berkshire shareholders use their stock as a savings account.

Still, Berkshire issued Class B shares in 1996 at a price equal to one thirtieth of a Class A share to cater to smaller investors wanting a small piece of the Buffett’s performance.

*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index slipped 0.16%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.31%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 18 points, or 0.04%.
*****
> In after-hours action, Nordstrom advanced 7% after the retailer posted adjusted earnings in the second quarter that surpassed expectations. Semiconductor developer Ambarella jumped nearly 20% on upbeat revenue guidance in the third quarter. PVH, owner of Calvin Klein, slumped more than 7% on a disappointing outlook for the current quarter.
*****
> During Tuesday’s trading session, the broad market index and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both added nearly 0.2%. Nvidia posted a roughly 1.5% gain that helped buoy both indexes. The 30-stock Dow, meanwhile, added just 0.02% — just enough to post a second straight record close.
*****
> Wall Street is keeping an eye on Nvidia, the leader of the artificial intelligence trade, to gauge the broader sustainability of the broader tech and AI trade. The semiconductor giant has surged 159% in 2024, raising questions of how much more room there is for the stock to run.

69,2024-08-28,84,"Limit Order after Hours in case NVIDIA misses earnings I’ve been a long time holder of Nvidia but sold at $136 because I had a feeling it had reached peak until next earnings.

I missed buying back in due to health issues, and now that I’m “back”, it’s risky to buy today - unless I set a limit after hours, correct?


Can I set a limit sell order for after hours a few dollars under the price before earnings (like 4:45 pm). Wouldn’t that protect me from losses in case NVIDIA misses targets?

EDIT:
I bought shares for $117 after hours by listening to the call and waiting for a nice entry.

6,2024-08-28,12,"Restriction margin account Charles Schwab.  Hello, I recently change my cash account at Charles Schwab for a margin account so I would be able to short the market as well. 

I just started looking into being a bit more active in trading. I bought some shorts on ADM and let them sit for a few days after which they automatically were closed by Charles Schwab and I got a message that I’m trading without settled funds. The exact message was:

“When you place a trade without sufficient settled funds or securities on deposit, we are required to make sure all of the following conditions are met:
- you make full cash payment promptly with settled funds or deliver previously owned securities into the account within the payment period;
- you keep the purchased securities until full payment with settled funds has been made;
- you do not make payments with the proceeds from the sale of other securities made after the trade date. 

If these conditions are not met we have to restrict trading”


My question is what I did wrong? I only bought 7 ADM shorts at 154. It the time Charles Schwab closed them they were in the profit at 152. 
I have an additional 1000 cash balance and worth about 3000 in stock positions (excluding the short on ADM).

15,2024-08-27,2,"Nordstrom shares jump 10% as earnings top estimates, but retailer issues cautious guidance  Nordstrom on Tuesday posted earnings that blew past Wall Street’s expectations, indicating the department store is making strides in its efforts to cut costs and boost efficiencies. 

Though the Seattle-based retailer posted earnings per share that were 25 cents higher than expected, it issued tepid guidance for the full year. 

Nordstrom now expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.75 and $2.05, compared to a previous range of $1.65 to $2.05. It anticipates sales will be in a range of a 1% decline to 1% growth from the prior year, compared to previous guidance of down 2% to up 1%. 

Shares rose more than 10% in extended trading.

Here’s how the department store did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 96 cents adjusted vs. 71 cents expected

Revenue: $3.89 billion vs. $3.90 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended August 3 was $122 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $137 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to supply chain impairments, the retailer posted adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share. 

Sales rose to $3.89 billion, up about 3.4% from $3.77 billion a year earlier. Revenue came in just shy of analysts’ expectations. 

As consumers continue to pull back on discretionary spending in the face of persistent inflation and high interest rates, retailers have been working to improve operations and cut costs to protect profits against softening demand. 

During the quarter, Nordstrom’s profits fell compared to the same period a year ago, but earnings grew over the last six months. Last year, Nordstrom reported a net loss of $67 million in the six months ended July 29, 2023, but in the same period this year, it posted a profit of $83 million. 

Nordstrom has said it is working to improve its supply chain. Last quarter, it said that the time it takes for online orders to arrive was over 5% faster. It’s also improved the way merchandise is making its way to customers and stores, which it said has helped drive higher conversion and lower return rates. 

Another key focus area for the company has been growing its off-price banner, Nordstrom Rack. Over the last couple of quarters, momentum has been growing at Nordstrom Rack and has helped prop up the company’s overall results. During the quarter, sales at Nordstrom Rack were up 8.8%, while comparable sales increased 4.1% compared to the same period a year ago.

That compares to Nordstrom’s mainline banner, which saw net sales and comparable sales each increase by just 0.9%. 

Nordstrom has been working to build more Rack locations and has opened 11 new locations so far this fiscal year, with a goal of opening at least 22 by the end of the year.

# What could stop the Nvidia frenzy?

# Two contradictions could stymie the AI chipmaker-in-chief

IF today’s stockmarkets have their version of the great wildebeest migration, it is the stampede of the Nvidia bulls. Wall Street is no Serengeti, and Jim Cramer’s high-pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough. But in other respects investors’ headlong rush into the American chipmaker’s shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.

Galloping sales of Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft, an AI-zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips, as [the world’s most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/06/20/nvidia-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-company). It proceeded to lose that title—and $900bn in value—amid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. “How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?” Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his CNBC show last week, referring to Nvidia’s boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, “Not an *Ursus nvidiaensis* in sight.”

For every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson, a veteran tech investor who was an early backer, teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade, a shade more than the total value today of the S&P 500 index of large American firms. All it would take is consistent annual sales growth of 60% at current operating margins of 60% or so, plus some plausible assumptions about cashflow. (Mr Anderson’s current employer, Lingotto, is owned by Exor, the biggest shareholder of *The Economist*’s parent company.)

Investment bankers at Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and UBS project that Nvidia’s yearly revenues will double this year, to over $100bn, grow by as much as half in 2025 and by double digits until at least 2027. By then its operating profit could exceed $150bn—a third more than Apple, tech’s most successful money-spinner, managed last year. The numbers are getting so big, so fast, that this alone should give the bulls pause. As they catch their breath, they might wish to ruminate on two contradictions lurking in Nvidia’s long-term growth story.

The first concerns its main supplier. Nvidia [designs chips](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market) but does not produce them. That falls to [TSMC](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/04/11/tsmcs-american-chipmaking-plans-grow-25bn-more-ambitious), a Taiwanese contract chipmaker that dominates the market for the cutting-edge silicon that goes into AI servers. As demand for these has rocketed, Nvidia has gone from one among many of TSMC’s clients to probably its second-biggest behind Apple. If it is indeed “customer B”, one of two that represent at least 10% of TSMC’s revenues and must thus be disclosed in regulatory filings, it spent $7.7bn with TSMC last year, up from $5.5bn two years earlier. Given that most of Nvidia’s purchase commitments of $19bn for 2025 are likely to end up with TSMC, it could soon eclipse the current “customer A”, which handed the Taiwanese firm just shy of $18bn in 2023.

Even as Nvidia’s and TSMC’s fates become more entwined, however, their product cycles are diverging. Earlier this year Mr Huang vowed to launch a new and improved AI chip every year, rather than every couple of years. TSMC is therefore in a mad rush to expand capacity, pledging to invest up to $32bn this year and possibly more in 2025. But it still needs at least 18 months to erect a new factory. And because these can cost $20bn a pop, careful discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. It is unclear how Nvidia’s accelerated timeline fits in with TSMC’s more measured pace of decision-making. In an early sign of trouble, Nvidia has delayed shipments of its latest chips, called Blackwell, by a couple of months owing to technical kinks.

Nvidia’s reliance on TSMC also highlights the second tension in the bulls’ case. Because the manufacturer controls the volume and efficiency of production, the only way for Nvidia to ensure that it meets investors’ bullish expectations for sales is to raise prices. A Blackwell chip will cost 20-25% more than the earlier generation, which was twice the price of the one before. Each chip is more powerful than the last, so the cost per unit of computing power is probably declining. But not fast enough for customers.

In August Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon, whose cloud-computing arm is a big user of Nvidia chips, acknowledged that he had “heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance”. His company is investing in its own designs. So are Google, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla. [AMD](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/31/could-amd-break-nvidias-chokehold-on-chips), a rival chip-designer, has gone from almost no AI-chip sales in 2022 to a forecast $5bn this year. On August 19th it said it would buy ZT Systems, a server maker, helping it to compete with Nvidia’s end-to-end offering. Chinese tech champions such as Huawei, barred by American sanctions from procuring top-end Nvidia gear, may forge breakthroughs that could do to Nvidia’s market share what Chinese competitors like BYD did to Tesla’s in electric cars.

# Exit pursued by a bear

Assuming a killer app eventually emerges—which it hasn’t yet—generative ai is unlikely to become widely used unless it gets much cheaper; a ChatGPT query can cost seven times more to answer than Google search. Nvidia may soon have to choose between lowering prices to support its growth or maintaining prices to protect its profit margin. For now Nvidia bulls think they can have it both ways. The whiff of irrational exuberance may become too overwhelming for *U. nvidiaensis* to resist. ■"

40,2024-08-27,11,"Eli Lilly Halves Zepbound Price In New Version Of Weight-Loss Drug Eli Lilly and Company ( LLY ) has launched a new dosage form of its weight-loss drug Zepbound at roughly half the price of its traditional price, aiming to reach more patients who don't have health insurance while also fighting off generics.

Eli Lilly will offer 2.5 mg and 5 mg single-dose Zepbound through its Web site at a monthly cost of $399 and $549, respectively. By comparison, the list price without insurance and discounts is about $1,000 per month.



Patients will need to self-inject using the new Zepbound syringe. The current version uses a single-dose auto-injector pen, which allows patients to inject directly under the skin with the touch of a button.



Eli Lilly says the vials are easier to manufacture than auto-injector pens, so they will increase the availability of Zepbound. While the lower cost may drive down Lilly's average Zepbound sales price in the short term, the additional sales of the vials “could have a positive impact on Lilly's sales results.”

Lilly's announcement on Zepbound's cardiovascular benefits comes on the heels of a recent study that found that a group of obese patients using Lilly's Mounjaro (the core ingredient in Tirzepatide), a drug that combines weight loss with diabetes treatment, had a more favorable outcome than a group using Novo Nordisk's Ozempic (the core ingredient in Ozempic), a drug that combines both weight loss and diabetes treatment. Ozempic (Semaglutide), a Novo Nordisk drug that also combines weight loss and diabetes treatment, showed significantly more weight loss than the group of obese patients using Ozempic (Semaglutide), a Novo Nordisk drug that also combines weight loss and diabetes treatment.

407,2024-08-27,109,"Intel board member quit after differences over chipmaker's revival plan The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday.

The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations.

Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. 

The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts.

Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report.

Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment.

Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders.

Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach.

This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth.

Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported.

Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said.

To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results.

The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts.

Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022.

To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago.

Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people.

Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said.

Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027.

An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully.

Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business.

Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said.

Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers.

Our 3-month investigation, which included interviews with former senior employees and industry experts as well as a review of litigation records, international corporate and customs records, found glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.  

In 2018, Super Micro was temporarily delisted from Nasdaq for failing to file financial statements. By August 2020, the company was charged by the SEC for “widespread accounting violations,” mainly related to $200+ million in improperly recognized revenue and understated expenses, resulting in artificially elevated sales, earnings and profit margins.  

Less than 3 months after paying a $17.5 million SEC settlement, Super Micro began re-hiring top executives that were directly involved in the accounting scandal, per litigation records and interviews with former employees.  

A former salesperson told us: “Almost all of them are back. Almost all of the people that were let go that were the cause of this malfeasance.”  

According to a lawsuit filed in April 2024, Super Micro waited only 3 months after the SEC settlement before restarting “improper revenue recognition,” “recognizing incomplete sales,” and “circumvention of internal accounting controls”.

2,2024-08-27,4,"Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) Navigating the Evolving COVID-19 Vaccine Landscape with a Diversified Pipeline **Overview**

Moderna, a pioneering biotechnology company, has transformed from a research-stage enterprise into a commercial powerhouse with a diverse clinical portfolio spanning infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, and autoimmune conditions. The company’s first commercial product, the COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax®, has already impacted hundreds of millions of lives globally. However, Moderna’s story extends far beyond its COVID-19 success, as it continues to leverage its mRNA platform to advance a robust pipeline of 40 development candidates across 47 programs, 43 of which are currently in clinical studies.

**Financials**

In the fiscal year 2023, Moderna reported annual revenue of $6,754 million and a net loss of $4,714 million. The company’s annual operating cash flow was negative $3,118 million, and its annual free cash flow was negative $3,825 million. These financial results reflect the significant investments Moderna is making to advance its diverse pipeline and build out its global commercial, regulatory, sales, and manufacturing infrastructure.

During the first quarter of 2024, Moderna reported net product sales of $167 million, a significant decline from the $1,828 million reported in the same period of the prior year. This decrease is indicative of the evolving nature of the endemic COVID-19 vaccine market, which has transitioned toward a more seasonal commercial pattern. The company expects this trend to persist, resulting in further projected reductions in net product sales for its COVID-19 vaccine relative to 2023.

**Business Overview**

Despite the decline in COVID-19 vaccine sales, Moderna remains focused on its long-term strategy of diversifying its revenue streams and advancing its robust pipeline. The company’s COVID-19 vaccine strategy for 2024 is centered on working with public health officials, healthcare providers, and pharmacies to increase vaccination coverage rates, particularly in the United States. In Europe, Moderna is actively participating in the 2024 tender process, which allows for up to 36 million doses per year for up to 4 years. In the Rest of the World, the company has reoriented its commercial teams to prioritize markets for greater commercial focus and impact, as evidenced by the recent contract with Brazil for 4.5 million doses.

**Pipeline Progress**

Moderna’s pipeline progress extends well beyond its COVID-19 vaccine. The company is eagerly awaiting the approval of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, which is expected to launch into a large market. In its first year, the older adult RSV market was $2.5 billion in sales, and analysts expect the older adults’ market to grow between $6 billion and $8 billion per year. Moderna’s RSV vaccine has a strong efficacy and safety profile in clinical trials and will be the only product available in a pre-filled syringe (PFS) presentation, which the company believes will ease the burden on pharmacies during the fall respiratory season.

In addition to its respiratory vaccine portfolio, Moderna is making significant strides in its latent virus vaccines, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The company’s CMV vaccine, mRNA-1647, has fully enrolled its Phase III trial, and Moderna is anticipating potential for Phase III efficacy data in 2024. The EBV vaccine candidate, mRNA-1189, has shown positive Phase I immunogenicity and safety data, and Moderna is now advancing towards pivotal trials.

Moderna’s individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) program, developed in collaboration with Merck, continues to demonstrate promising results. The partners have initiated three new randomized clinical studies in additional tumor types in 2024, including a Phase 2 adjuvant treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma, a Phase 2 adjuvant treatment in patients with high-risk muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and a Phase 2/3 neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

**Liquidity**

The company’s financial position remains strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling approximately $12.2 billion as of March 31, 2024. This robust balance sheet enables Moderna to continue investing in its pipeline and commercial operations. In March 2024, the company entered into a development and commercialization funding arrangement with Blackstone Life Sciences, which will provide up to $750 million in funding to support the advancement of Moderna’s investigational mRNA-based influenza vaccine program.

Moderna’s commitment to financial discipline is evident in its operating expense management. During the first quarter of 2024, the company’s total operating expenses decreased by almost $800 million compared to the same period in 2023. This reduction was driven by lower spending in manufacturing, development, and selling, general, and administrative functions.

**Outlook**

Looking ahead, Moderna expects net sales for 2024 to be approximately $4 billion, which the company believes will be a low point as it expects to return to growth in 2025. The company anticipates cost of sales to be approximately 35% of product sales for the full year, down from 70% in 2023, reflecting improvements in manufacturing efficiency and expected reductions in inventory write-downs.

**Conclusion**

Moderna’s diversified pipeline, strong financial position, and focus on operational efficiency position the company well to navigate the evolving COVID-19 vaccine market and continue advancing its broader therapeutic and vaccine programs. As the company continues to execute on its strategic priorities, investors will closely monitor the progress of its late-stage clinical candidates, including the RSV vaccine, CMV vaccine, and INT program, as well as the potential launch of its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine programs.

825,2024-08-27,440,"Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robots * Tesla stock is in a ""quagmire,"" the longtime investor Ross Gerber has said.
* He said he'd sold about $60 million in Tesla shares amid growing concerns over the carmaker.
* Gerber told Yahoo Finance that no one seemed interested in buying Tesla's cars anymore.

  
One of Tesla's longtime investors has dumped about half his stake in Elon Musk's carmaker.



The shareholder, Ross Gerber, has said that's because no one seems interested in buying Tesla's cars or robots.



Gerber, who's been a loud critic of Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, said he had sold about 60 million worth of his Tesla shares. He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.



""Over time, I've just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,"" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla's robotics and full-self-driving tech. ""That's just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,"" he added.



Other Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company's trajectory. Tesla's stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk's legal battles.



Gerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he'd been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.



""It's really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn't actually work there, who doesn't try to sell the cars,"" Gerber said, adding: ""We've seen sales go down, and that's what's happening. Sales are going down. If you're expecting a great quarter, you're wrong. They're not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.""



And while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla's humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.



""The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?"" Gerber said, adding: ""The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don't know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.""



Musk's leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board of directors, calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.

121,2024-08-26,130,"Still meaningful alpha left in NVIDIA? Nvidia Thesis ($200 PT by Dec-2025, 53% Gross, 38% IRR)

P.S.: Not financial advice, just my quick read-through of fundamentals

Nvidia is the world’s largest chip company, spearheading the global AI revolution. It holds a dominant 98% market share in Data Center GPUs.
Last fiscal year, Nvidia generated $60 billion in revenue, with ~80% coming from its Data Center segment. This year, revenue is expected to double to $120B, with ~$105B coming from Data Centers.
I believe there’s a ~50% upside in the stock by the end of 2025, translating to a 38% IRR. The current street estimates for Nvidia’s Data Center revenue in 2025 and 2026 stand at $150B and $170B, respectively. However, I find these projections conservative. My analysis points to $200B in 2026 Data Center revenue, translating to ~$5 EPS in CY2026. Applying a 40x NTM PE (Nvidia’s typical trading multiple) yields a $200 price target by the end of 2025.
Key Reasons for My Bullish Thesis:
1. We are in the early stages of the AI Arms Race.
    * Hyperscalers have spent $200B on capex over the last two years, with plans to spend $700B over the next 2.5 years—much of it allocated to AI and GPUs.
    * Microsoft currently operates 192 data centers and plans to scale to 900 by 2028. If Microsoft is this aggressive, other hyperscalers are likely to pursue similar aggressive expansion plans.
    * Large Language Model (LLM) capacity is doubling every six months. For instance, Claude 3’s context window (now 200K tokens) is projected to increase to 1 million tokens by next year. Such improvements necessitate hyper-demand growth for powerful GPUs that can serve both training and inferencing. There isn't any chip, apart from NVIDIA's Blackwell, that can meet this demand.
2. Supply Chain Insights: Have been looking into supply chain data, and all data points reflect
    * TSMC’s CoWoS production, crucial for Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture, is set to grow from 15,000 units/month in 2023 to 40,000 by late 2024—a ~3x increase.
    * Applied Materials has revised its HBM packaging revenue forecast from 4x to 6x growth this year.
    * SK Hynix and Samsung are reallocating 20% of their DRAM production to HBM3e.
    * AMD’s CEO estimates the AI chip market will be worth $400 billion by 2027; Intel's CEO puts the number at $1 trillion by 2030
3. Blackwell Product Roadmap:
    * Nvidia is transitioning from a 2-year to a 1-year product cycle. The B100 and GB200 chips will ship later this year, with the B200 expected in early 2025. This is one of the most aggressive product roadmaps in industry's history. In my estimate, NVIDIA could sell 60,000 units of GB200 systems with $2M per unit price, driving $120B in annual revenue in 2025 from GB200 alone."
223,2024-08-26,61,"Apple to replace CFO Luca Maestri on Jan. 1  Apple announced Monday that it will replace Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri on Jan. 1 with current Apple insider Kevan Parekh.

Maestri will continue to lead teams focusing on IT, security, and real estate development, Apple said. He had been Apple CFO since 2014.

Parekh, the incoming CFO, has been on Maestri’s finance leadership team for years as the company’s VP of Financial Planning and Analysis.

“For more than a decade, Kevan has been an indispensable member of Apple’s finance leadership team, and he understands the company inside and out. His sharp intellect, wise judgment, and financial brilliance make him the perfect choice to be Apple’s next CFO,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.

Maestri was named Apple CFO in 2014, before the stock began a torrid run, partially powered by strong demand for iPhones. He oversaw Apple’s record-breaking capital return program, and appeared alongside Cook on quarterly earnings calls.

In 2014, Apple’s annual sales were about $183 billion. Last year, Apple reported $383 billion in revenue. Apple stock is up over 800% since Maestri became CFO.

0,2024-08-26,16,"Starbucks Short? Inverse Cramer Cramer seems to think the appointment of Niccols not only justifies the $27b increase in market cap, but that the stock will continue to run up. Does anyone think the stock has overreacted and shouldn't be at this level?

I see a lot of issues that Starbucks needs to fix. They no longer are the ""third space"" that people go to hang out at. The stores I've looked at are all ditry and outdated, nothing like the European cafes that inspired Starbucks in the early days. Their coffee quality can't compare to local coffee shops. In major cities, the trends I see are people going local while Starbucks stores sit empty. Their food selection is terrible, which is one area that I think Niccols will be able to fix.  I think long term they could still right the ship but in the short term, this just seems to be overvalued.

I've been analysing the Seeking Alpha Picks service, I'm kinda impressed that it seems to work and it seems people are actually making money with it.

But what I struggle to understand is how and why it works, I've analysed some of their picks of last 7-8 months, and they all seem to have something in common:  
- It picks stocks with recent momentum , follow the trend I get.  
- It seems that when SA picks signals the BUY, the stocks pumps up, I am not sure how many people follow this and if is a significant amount to cause this or not.  
  
So I notice that a lot of their picks are at all-time-highs and then the stock just goes up even more, I can't see what methodology would signal buys at all time highs in consistent way, some of those stocks are not even fundamentally attractive or at good valuation when it says BUY... which makes me believe the stock is pumped because SA Picks signal the BUY, what do you think? Does this make any sense?"

163,2024-08-26,112,"Morgan Stanley is cutting its position in Tesla stock. Here's why It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.

Morgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a “continued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences” for EVs.

TSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley’s model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.

Since the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.

“While we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,” they wrote.

Despite Tesla’s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).

Earlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.

These new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.

In June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles ""heavily benefit from unfair subsidies"" and present a ""threat of economic injury"" to European EV producers."

--------------------------------------------

SUMMARIES OF MAJOR CRISES 

1. 1973 Oil Crisis
 Triggered by the OPEC oil embargo, which led to a quadrupling of oil prices. This caused severe inflation, economic recession, and a sharp decline in stock markets worldwide.

2. Black Monday (1987)
On October 19, 1987, global stock markets crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 22.6% in a single day. The exact causes are debated but include computerised trading and overvaluation.

3. Japanese Asset Price Bubble (1991)
A massive speculative bubble in Japanese real estate and stock markets burst in the early 1990s. The Nikkei index lost about 50% of its value, leading to a prolonged economic slump known as the ""Lost Decade.""

4. Asian Financial Crisis (1997)
Beginning in Thailand with the collapse of its currency, the crisis spread across East Asia, leading to massive currency devaluations, stock market declines, and economic turmoil in countries like South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

5. Dot-com Bubble Burst (2000)
After a period of extreme speculation in internet-related companies, the bubble burst, leading to a massive decline in the NASDAQ and global stock markets. Many tech companies went bankrupt, and trillions of dollars in market value were wiped out.

6. Global Financial Crisis (2007-2008)
The most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression, triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market and the failure of major financial institutions. Stock markets around the world plummeted, leading to the Great Recession.

7. European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2010)
The crisis started with concerns over Greece's high debt levels and quickly spread to other Eurozone countries. Stock markets across Europe fell sharply, and there were fears of a Euro collapse, leading to significant volatility in global markets.

8. Chinese Stock Market Crash (2015)
A dramatic decline in the Chinese stock market, fueled by a combination of high levels of margin trading and government intervention. This led to a significant drop in global stock markets, with concerns about China's economic slowdown.

0,2024-08-25,10,"AI in advertising - can it justify the cost? Here’s a question:
Gen AI costs a lot. It will inevitably change the world, but the question is how much money it will be able to generate.


Back then when internet came and reformed the world, it has opened a completely new market.
Let’s talk big here - advertising.


Of course AI is opening a lot of new markets, but small markets. It is essentially an improvement on the internet. But how will it disrupt the advertising market? 


Population growth is slowing down. Almost everyone has a smartphone now, and almost everyone spends as much time on the internet as they can. Maybe there is growth until gen X gets completely replaced, where really almost everyone will actively use the internet for everything.


My question is at the current status of the world, is it the case of large companies stealing each others share from the market, or there are still parts left from the cake?


In limited people in the world, with limited people left to conquer, everyone having smart phone, watching the maximum amount of ads people tolerate, what’s left to get? The only way I see here is to sell more expensive ads. How can companies keep up with the extreme growth rate we seen in tech so far?


Maybe AI can create even more accurately targeted ads, with extremely high conversion rate, in which case ads can be sold for more, but still there won’t be that much more people to show more ads to. Can the ads performance justify the massive costs of AI, or it’s just the case of every large company burning up their money on AI just to cover their existing shares from the market, in which case I can’t see uptrend there, just a massive bear market.


In any case, I see Meta a very strong player here, the disruption of making LLAMA open source was just brilliant, strong on ads, and one of the earliest players in the ai game.

98,2024-08-24,52,"Do you also have these ""mental traps""? I've been investing for one year, so I consider myself a newbie. I completed a 3-month course on investing and decided to go all in. So far, I’m up 20% on my trial-and-error portfolio. What I’ve noticed through this process is that I'm extremely irrational—yeah, I said it out loud...

* I prefer to add to my positions only during dips; I just can't make myself stick to dollar-cost averaging. I have monthly allocated cash to invest, which I keep aside earning 5% interest until I see a dip.
* I'm unhappy when the market goes up because I feel I ""missed"" the chance to buy at lower prices companies on my watchlist.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

208,2024-08-23,72,"Roadside Tesla Semi fire where temperatures reached 1,000 degrees draws in NTSB investigative team A crash and large fire along a California freeway involving an electric Tesla Semi has drawn the attention of federal safety investigators.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it’s sending a team of investigators from the Office of Highway Safety mainly to look into fire risks posed by lithium-ion batteries.

The team will work with the California Highway Patrol to “examine the wreckage and gather details about the events leading up to the collision and the subsequent fire response,” the agency said in a statement.

The Los Angeles Times reported that the Tesla rig was traveling east on Interstate 80 around 3:15 a.m. Monday near Emigrant Gap, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast of Sacramento, when it went off the road and collided with trees near the right shoulder.

The battery caught fire, spewing toxic fumes and reaching a temperature of 1,000 degrees, forcing firefighters to wait for it to burn out, the Highway Patrol told the newspaper. The Tesla driver walked away from the crash and was taken to a hospital, and the freeway was temporarily closed.

The battery burned into the late afternoon while firefighters tried to cool it down for cleanup, and the freeway didn’t reopen until 7:20 p.m., authorities said.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the crash and fire from Tesla.

After an investigation that ended in 2021 the NTSB determined that high-voltage electric vehicle battery fires pose risks to first responders and that guidelines from manufacturers about how to deal with them were inadequate.

The agency, which has no enforcement powers and can only make recommendations, called for manufacturers to write vehicle-specific response guides for fighting battery fires and limiting chemical thermal runaway and reignition. The guidelines also should include information on how to safely store vehicles with damaged lithium-ion batteries, the agency said.

Tesla began delivering the electric Semis in December of 2022, more than three years after CEO Elon Musk said his company would start making the trucks. Musk has said the Semi has a range per charge of 500 miles (800 kilometers) when pulling an 82,000-pound (37,000-kilo) load.

120,2024-08-22,66,"Cava earnings beat estimates as restaurant traffic climbs nearly 10%  Cava on Thursday raised its full-year outlook as its restaurants reported strong traffic, fueling better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue.

Shares of the company rose 7% in extended trading. The stock has more than doubled its value this year, bringing Cava’s market cap up to about $11.6 billion, as of Thursday’s close.

Here’s what the company reported for the quarter ended July 14 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 17 cents vs. 13 cents expected

Revenue: $233 million vs. $220 million expected

The Mediterranean restaurant chain reported fiscal second-quarter net income of $19.7 million, or 17 cents per share, up from $6.5 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.

Net sales climbed 35% to $233 million. The company’s same-store sales rose 14.4%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 7.9%.

While many other restaurant companies have reported declines in visits as consumers pull back their spending, Cava said its traffic grew 9.5% in the quarter. Cava CEO and co-founder Brett Schulman credited the chain’s new grilled steak option as one reason why customers kept coming to its restaurants during the quarter.

Cava opened 18 net new locations during the quarter, bringing its total footprint up to 341 restaurants.

For fiscal 2024, Cava now expects same-store sales growth of 8.5% to 9.5%, up from its prior range of 4.5% to 6.5%. The company is also projecting that it will open 54 to 57 new locations this year, up from its previous forecast of 50 to 54 restaurants.

Cava also expects to report adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $109 million to $114 million. Previously, it was projecting adjusted EBITDA of $100 million to $105 million for the fiscal year.

68,2024-08-22,32,"Zoom stock has best day in almost two years on quarterly results, increased guidance  Zoom shares soared the most since November 2022 on Thursday after the video chat company reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter and raised its full-year guidance.

The stock rose 13% to close at $68.04. The shares are still down 5.4% for the year, while the Nasdaq has gained 17% over that stretch.

Zoom said revenue in the quarter rose 2.1% from a year earlier to $1.16 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.15 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.39, ahead of the $1.21 average estimate.

For the full fiscal year, Zoom now expects revenue of $4.63 billion to $4.64 billion. The last time Zoom provided guidance, the company said the top end of the expected range was $4.62 billion.

While Zoom has struggled to reaccelerate growth following the slowdown from the pandemic surge, the company has stabilized, reducing customer churn and bolstering its contact center business. CEO Eric Yuan said on the call that Zoom landed its biggest contact center customer ever in the second quarter.

Still, the shares are down almost 90% from their record in October 2020.

Net income in the second quarter increased to $219 million, or 70 cents per share, from $182 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier.

Separately, Zoom said CFO Kelly Steckelberg is leaving the company after it reports results for the third quarter. Yuan said the company has hired an executive search firm to find a replacement for Steckelberg, who joined Zoom in 2017.

31,2024-08-22,17,"GM-owned Cruise will partner with Uber to offer driverless rides Uber Technologies and General Motors' Cruise have agreed to a multi-year partnership, under which the embattled autonomous vehicle company plans to offer driverless rides to Uber users as soon as next year.

The Thursday announcement comes as Cruise attempts to revive its robotaxi business after the company ceased operations following an October 2023 incident in which a pedestrian in San Francisco was dragged 20 feet by a driverless Cruise vehicle after she was first struck by a human driver in another car.

State and federal regulators have investigated the incident, which led to an exodus of Cruise leaders including CEO and co-founder Kyle Vogt, as well as significant layoffs.

Both Cruise CEO Marc Whitten and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi hailed the partnership in a press release, stressing that the companies believe autonomous vehicles can be deployed safely.

""Cruise is on a mission to leverage driverless technology to create safer streets and redefine urban life,"" Whitten said in the release. ""We are excited to partner with Uber to bring the benefits of safe, reliable, autonomous driving to even more people, unlocking a new era of urban mobility.""

Khosrowshahi said in the release that Uber is ""thrilled to partner with Cruise and look forward to launching next year."" 

In 2016, Uber aimed to develop its own autonomous vehicle technology and partnered with Volvo to do so. But it abandoned the effort after a 2018 incident, in which an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a woman named Elaine Herzberg as she was walking her bicycle across a road in Tempe, Arizona. The Uber safety driver on board at the time, Rafaela Vasquez, was ultimately held legally liable for the incident.

Since then, Uber has emerged as a partner to other autonomous vehicle developers. It has partnered with Google-owned Waymo to offer driverless rides or food delivery to Uber users via robotaxis in Arizona.

On Uber's most recent earnings call, analysts asked the company how the emergence of robotaxis would likely impact the ridehailing giant's business long-term.

Khosrowshahi said on the call that ""AV players"" experience much higher utilization with Uber than they do ""without a network on a first-party basis."" He also predicted there will be a ""pretty long hybrid period as autonomous is developing and regulators are trying to figure out exactly how to regulate it."" He added, ""We don't think this will be a winner-take-all market.""

Cruise competitor Waymo said this week that it is already delivering 100,000 paid robotaxi rides per week in cities where it operates commercially in the US: San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. The company is also testing in and plans to expand its service into Austin, Texas.

The new partnership isn't the first time GM has partnered with a ride-haling company. GM invested $500 million in Lyft in early 2016, with plans to eventually develop a fleet of autonomous vehicles that could be summoned using Lyft's mobile app. That never happened, as GM decided to instead launch its own vehicles and network through Cruise.

A Cruise spokeswoman said the company remains focused on relaunching its own driverless ridehailing service and app, despite the Thursday announcement.

Cruise is currently conducting supervised autonomous vehicle testing with a safety driver in Phoenix, Dallas and Houston.

509,2024-08-22,240,"Peloton to start charging subscribers with used equipment $95 activation fee  Peloton on Thursday said it will start charging new subscribers a one-time $95 activation fee if they bought their hardware on the secondary market as more consumers snag lightly used equipment for a fraction of the typical retail price.

The used equipment activation fee for subscribers in the U.S. and Canada comes as Peloton starts to see a meaningful increase in new members who bought used Bikes or Treads from peer-to-peer markets such as Facebook Marketplace. 

During its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30, Peloton said it saw a “steady stream of paid connected fitness subscribers” who bought hardware on the secondary market. The company said the segment grew 16% year over year.

“We believe a meaningful share of these subscribers are incremental, and they exhibit lower net churn rates than rental subscribers,” the company said in a letter to shareholders. 

“It’s also worth highlighting that this activation fee will be a source of incremental revenue and gross profit for us, helping to support our investments in improving the fitness experience for our members,” interim co-CEO Christopher Bruzzo later added on a call with analysts. 

While plenty of Peloton subscribers are avid users of the home workout machines, some have likened them to glorified clothes racks because so many people stop using the equipment. Those people paid Peloton for that hardware originally, but importantly, many of them have canceled their monthly subscription, which is how Peloton makes the bulk of its money. 

The ability to attract new, budget-conscious members from the secondary market who are willing to pay for a monthly subscription is a unique opportunity for Peloton to grow revenue without any upfront cost, on top of the revenue from the original sale. 

Ari Kimmelfeld — whose startup Trade My Stuff, formerly known as Trade My Spin, sells used Peloton equipment — estimates there are around a million Bikes collecting dust in homes around the world that could be a source of new revenue for the company. 

He told CNBC he previously met with Peloton executives to discuss ways to collaborate, because every time he sells a used piece of equipment, it could lead to more than $500 in new revenue per year for Peloton. With the new used equipment activation fee, that number could grow to more than $600 for the first year. 

“We save the customer a lot more than $95,” Kimmelfeld told CNBC on Thursday after the new activation fee was announced. “I don’t think it’ll stop or slow down people from buying secondary equipment … because you can get a bike delivered faster and cheaper on the secondary market, even with the $95, let’s call it a tax, from Peloton.” 

Trade My Stuff sells first-generation Bikes for $499, compared with $1,445 new. It offers the Bike+ for $1,199, compared with $2,495 new. It also sells used Treads for $1,999, compared with $2,995 new. 

Since launching his business, Kimmelfeld has worked with people looking to sell their used Peloton equipment and has since sold a “few thousand” Bikes. In 14 cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Denver and New York City, the company offers same- or next-day delivery. Outside of those locales, it provides delivery within three to five days. That compares with a new Peloton purchase, which can take significantly longer to deliver. 

The used equipment activation fee is designed to ensure that new members “receive the same high-quality onboarding experience Peloton is known for,” the company said. Bruzzo said that those who buy a used Bike or Bike+ have access to a virtual custom fitting ahead of their first ride, as well as a history summary that shows how many rides those bikes had before they were resold. 

“We’re also offering these new members discounts on accessories such as bike shoes, bike mats and spare parts,” said Bruzzo. “We’ll continue to lean into this important channel and find additional ways to improve the new member experience, for example, providing early education about the broad range of fitness modalities that we offer and the many series and programs our instructors provide to new members.”

33,2024-08-22,1,"July home sales break a four-month losing streak as supply rises nearly 20% over last year [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/july-home-sales-break-4-month-losing-streak-as-supply-rises-nearly-20percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/july-home-sales-break-4-month-losing-streak-as-supply-rises-nearly-20percent.html)

Closed sales of previously owned homes rose 1.3% in July compared with June to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 3.95 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was the first gain in five months.

Sales were 2.5% lower compared with the same time last year.

Sales saw the biggest gains in the Northeast and were flat in the Midwest. Prices also rose the most in the Northeast.

“Despite the modest gain, home sales are still sluggish,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, in a release. “But consumers are definitely seeing more choices, and affordability is improving due to lower interest rates.”

These sales are based on contracts that were likely signed in May and June, when mortgage rates were well over 7% on the popular 30-year fixed loan. Rates began dropping in July and are now hovering around 6.5%.

All-cash offers made up 27% of July sales, up from 26% the year before and far higher than the historical norm.

The supply of homes for sale continued to move higher in July. At the end of the month, there were 1.33 million homes on the market, an increase of 0.8% from June and 19.8% higher than in July 2023. At the current sales pace, that represents a four-month supply, slightly lower than it was in June.

The increase in supply did not, however, help to cool home prices. The median price of an existing home sold in July was $442,600, an increase of 4.2% year-over-year.

First-time buyers made up 29% of sales in July, unchanged from June but down from 30% in July 2023. Historically, these buyers make up closer to 40% of home sales, but affordability has been hit hard in the last two years due to fast-rising home prices and higher mortgage rates.

With rates now slightly lower, demand is starting to pick up. A separate report from Redfin, a real estate brokerage, found requests for tours and other buying services from Redfin agents rose 4% over the last week to its highest level in two months.

77,2024-08-22,9,"TD Bank swings to quarterly loss after $2.6 billion hit tied to US probe TD Bank missed quarterly earnings estimates on Thursday and reported a rare loss after it set aside a further $2.6 billion to prepare for fines from U.S. regulators following investigations into the Canadian lender's anti-money laundering (AML) measures.

The bank's U.S. business, which accounts for about a quarter of TD's profit, reported a 5.6% fall in net income hurt by lower deposit volumes and loan margins.

The U.S. has been a key growth market for the bank where it has invested billions over the past two decades to acquire smaller regional banks on the east coast, building a network of 1,100 branches, more than it has across Canada.

The regulatory probe was disclosed last year shortly after TD terminated its $13.4 billion First Horizon acquisition that would have added about 400 branches to its network in the southeast U.S.

TD said a provision of $3 billion it has taken so far reflects its estimate of the total fines it would have to pay, but it could also face non-monetary penalties from U.S. regulators.

""These may include an asset cap that would restrict loan growth... If growth here is restricted, TD could deliver sub-par earnings growth relative to peers over the next several years,"" National Bank analyst Gabriel Dechaine wrote.

The $2.6 billion provision announced on Wednesday comes on top of $450 million it set aside in April.

The probes have been a major overhang on TD's stock over the last year, with investors concerned about the resolution timeline and potential cost. The clarification of the direct financial impact of the bank's AML issues could result in a short-term ""relief rally,"" Dechaine said.

The stock has fallen 5% so far this year, underperforming the TSX banking index's 8.6% growth.

In Canada, personal and commercial banking recorded a 13% rise in net income driven by new account openings and volume growth. TD's wealth management and insurance earnings were flat, reflecting impact from severe weather events.

The net loss was C$181 million, or 14 Canadian cents per share, in the three months ended July 31, compared with a profit of C$2.88 billion, or C$1.53 per share, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, TD earned C$2.05 ($1.51) per share, 2 Canadian cents short of analysts' estimates, according to LSEG data.

Provision for credit losses rose to C$1.07 billion, compared with C$766 million a year ago.

43,2024-08-22,32,"Peloton shares rise more than 10% as turnaround plan takes hold, losses shrink  Peloton said Thursday it is digging itself out of the red and eked out a slight sales increase for the first time in nine quarters as it slashed its overall losses. 

The beleaguered connected fitness company, which is currently being run by two board members after former CEO Barry McCarthy resigned earlier this year, saw sales grow by 0.2% during its fiscal fourth quarter. While only a modest uptick, it’s the first time Peloton posted year-over-year revenue growth since its 2021 holiday quarter. 

The company also indicated it’s ready to focus on profitability over growth with significant cuts to its marketing and sales spending and meaningful increases to free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. Those cuts helped Peloton narrow its quarterly losses to $30.5 million from $241.1 million in the year-ago period.

The company’s shares rose more than 10% in premarket trading.

Here’s how the Bike and Tread maker performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Loss per share: 8 cents vs. 17 cents expected

Revenue: $644 million vs. $631 million expected

For the three-month period that ended June 30, Peloton significantly narrowed its losses. The company posted a loss of $30.5 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with a loss of $241.8 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $643.6 million, up about 0.2% from $642.1 million a year earlier. That’s only a $1.5 million increase, but Peloton did it at a time when sales are typically a bit slower for the company, because the quarter bleeds into the summer when people are more focused on going out and traveling than working out. The last time Peloton delivered year-over-year sales growth was during its holiday season in 2021, which is typically the company’s strongest quarter.

Secondary market gains

During the quarter, sales for Peloton’s pricy connected fitness hardware fell about 4%, continuing a trend for the company. But subscription revenue rose by 2.3%, and the segment’s gross margin increased by 1 percentage point.

Though hardware sales were down, Peloton is growing its subscription revenue through the secondary market where people can buy used stationary bikes for a fraction of the cost of a new one. During the quarter, subscription revenue from hardware purchased on the secondary market grew 16% year over year.

“We believe a meaningful share of these subscribers are incremental, and they exhibit lower net churn rates than rental subscribers,” the company said in a letter to shareholders.

While hardware sales have hurt Peloton’s overall performance, sales for its Tread are growing after it overcame a costly recall. During the quarter, sales from Peloton’s treadmill portfolio grew 42% year over year.

The company is also seeing some positive signs in its Bike rental program, which allowed it to clear through a glut of inventory. During the quarter, average net monthly paid subscription churn for rentals was down 1.1 percentage points. Demand has been so steady, it no longer has the refurbished inventory levels necessary to supply that side of the program. The company ceased offering its original Bike rental program on Aug. 1 and since then, has seen demand grow for its Bike+ rental, refurbished original Bike sales and financed new Bike sales.

“These alternative programs have stronger unit economics than original Bike rental, with more cash paid upfront and a stronger retention profile,” the company said in its shareholder letter.

Ever since Peloton’s pandemic heyday came to an end, the company has struggled to generate free cash flow and ensure it has enough assets on its balance sheet to cover its many liabilities. Earlier this year, it announced a sprawling restructuring plan that included cutting 15% of the company’s global workforce to achieve $200 million in annualized cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025.

Those efforts are starting to bear fruit.

During the quarter, Peloton delivered adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the second consecutive quarter – a feat it had not pulled off since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. It posted $70 million of adjusted EBITDA, far more than the $53 million that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. 

That metric was up $105 million compared with the year-ago period and $64 million quarter over quarter.

Peloton also generated $26 million in free cash flow, compared with negative $74 million in the year-ago period and $8 million in the prior quarter.

Improvements to Peloton’s balance sheet come after the company completed massive refinancing of its debt that staved off a looming liquidity crunch and pushed out its debt maturities by several years.

Peloton noted that the search for its next CEO is “top of mind for all stakeholders.” “The process is well underway and we look forward to sharing more when we have an announcement,” it said.

Profit over growth

For the year ahead, Peloton is planning to invest in its hardware and software to deliver a better user experience, among other initiatives. However, its guidance assumes that investments in these new initiatives “will not deliver subscriber growth within the fiscal year,” indicating Peloton may finally be shifting its focus away from growth in favor of profitability and free cash flow generation.

That’s evidenced by its reductions to sales and marketing spending — an expense that has long dragged down Peloton’s balance sheet and has been criticized as being too high for the company’s size.

During the quarter, Peloton cut sales and marketing spending by $25.5 million, or 19% year over year. It said it expects to continue to make reductions to its marketing budget throughout fiscal 2025.

For the current quarter, Peloton is projecting sales to be worse than Wall Street expected but is guiding to higher-than-forecast adjusted EBITDA. The company said it anticipates sales to be between $560 million and $580 million, compared with estimates of $609 million, according to LSEG. It’s expecting to post adjusted EBITDA of $50 million to $60 million, compared with estimates of $45 million, according to StreetAccount.

StreetAccount analysts had expected the number of connected fitness subscribers to be 2.96 million during the current quarter, but Peloton projects a range of 2.88 million to 2.89 million instead.

For the full year, Peloton expects sales to be between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, compared with estimates of $2.7 billion, according to LSEG.

24,2024-08-22,0,"Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Kansas City shut freight network after impasse over union talks  Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) shut down their rail networks in the country on Thursday and locked out nearly 10,000 workers after unsuccessful negotiations with a major labor union.

The decision, confirmed by the Teamsters union, sets the stage for an unprecedented rail stoppage that could badly damage the Canadian economy and have a significant effect on cross-border trade with the United States.

Canada is the world’s second-largest country by area and relies heavily on rail transport. The stoppage is set to cripple shipments of grain, potash and coal while also slowing the transport of petroleum products, chemicals and autos.

Industry groups had urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government to prevent a stoppage, noting Canada’s railways transport around C$380 billion ($277 billion) worth of goods annually.

U.S. railroad Union Pacific said on Tuesday a stoppage would halt the movement of 2,500 rail cars across the border daily.

The Canadian and U.S. economies are highly integrated. Rail transport accounted for 14% of total bilateral trade of $382.4 billion between the countries for the first half of the year, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.

The stoppage comes after months of talks. The union and the companies struggled to reach an agreement on key terms, with both sides accusing the other of bad faith.

The union is seeking improved provisions for fatigue, rest, and scheduling, stressing the need for worker safety.

CN said it had offered better wages and fewer working days, but the “union did not respond”, while CPKC said its offer included competitive wage hikes and increased shift differentials.

However, CPKC said that a negotiated outcome with the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) union was not within reach and the companies urged the union to engage in negotiations.

Teamsters said none of its offers were “seriously considered” by the companies, adding that it will remain at the bargaining table with both firms despite the lockout.

82,2024-08-22,42,"Snowflake Gives Outlook That Fails to Calm Investors on AI Snowflake Inc. gave a sales outlook that failed to reassure investors that the company will gain ground in the market for artificial intelligence software tools. The shares fell in extended traded.

Product revenue, which makes up the bulk of Snowflake’s business, will be $850 million to $855 million in the period ending in October, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, predicted $848 million, although some estimates exceeded $900 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also raised its fiscal year product sales forecast to $3.36 billion from $3.3 billion.

Under Chief Executive Officer Sridhar Ramaswamy, Snowflake has launched products focused on generative AI and other new ways to analyze large sets of data. The strategy is fueled in part by increased pressure from rivals including Databricks Inc. and cloud infrastructure providers like Microsoft Corp. Snowflake offers software that helps customers find, organize and use huge amounts of information from a variety of sources.

Ramaswamy touted “product delivery, and great traction in the early stages of our new AI products.”

Still, Snowflake is navigating a challenging environment between a recent CEO change, security breaches of its customers and some market shift to products outside its traditional wheelhouse, wrote Derrick Wood, an analyst at TD Cowen, ahead of the results.

In the fiscal second quarter, total revenue rose 29% to $868.8 million — coming in under 30% for the first time in Snowflake’s history as a publicly traded company.

The shares declined about 7% in extended trading after closing at $135.06 in New York. The stock has dropped 32% this year, as investors have been concerned about Snowflake’s ability to catch up in AI-oriented tools.

Clients including AT&T Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc.’s Ticketmaster and LendingTree Inc. had their Snowflake accounts breached as part of a hacking campaign beginning in May. Snowflake has said its own systems weren’t infiltrated and has added features for customers to implement better security settings.

“We obviously had some rough headlines in the quarter,” Ramaswamy said of the customer breaches during a conference call after the results were released. “The issue wasn’t on the Snowflake side.”

Product revenue increased 30% to $829 million in the quarter, compared with the $813 million expected by analysts. Adjusted profit, excluding some items, was 18 cents a share, just ahead of the average estimate of 16 cents a share.

Snowflake now has 510 customers that spent more than $1 million over a trailing 12-month period, up from 485 the previous quarter. Remaining performance obligations — another key benchmark of growth — were $5.2 billion in the period ended July 31, topping analysts’ average estimate of about $5 billion.

The company has added about 1,000 workers over the last year in a period when many peers were shedding employees or selectively hiring. Snowflake said it had 7,630 employees as of the second quarter.

213,2024-08-21,55,"15 Ways to Lose Money in the Markets **1. Pretend you’re smarter than the market.** Investing is easy! Outsmarting the market isn’t that difficult! Surely, you’re more intelligent than the collective wisdom of millions of other investors.

How hard can it really be to beat the market?

**2. Consistently try to time the market.** Think and act in extremes. Go all in when it feels like the market is in a good place. Get out of the market when things seem dicey. Keep jumping in and out until you are rich.

Anyone can do it.

**3. Chase performance.** Follow the hot hand. Invest with the star fund manager the financial media just fell in love with. Follow fads. Take tips on the hottest stocks.

There’s no luck involved in short-term outperformance. It’s all skill.

**4. Fight the last war.** Hedge the huge risk that just happened. Buy the Black Swan fund after the huge crash just occurred. Invest in that inflation hedge after prices have already skyrocketed. Make the decisions you wish you would have made before you lost money.

Driving in the rearview mirror feels safe so it should work, right?

**5. Take investment advice from billionaires.** When billionaires go on financial television or share their thoughts on the markets or the economy they are talking directly to you. They know your financial circumstances, risk tolerance and time horizon. They follow the exact same investment strategy as you. They never change their minds or make statements to the financial press they don’t actually believe.

What’s the harm in buying some puts just like George Soros or Stanley Druckenmiller?

Billionaires are just like us!

**6. Worry more about being right than making money.** Who cares about your investment results? Intellectual superiority is where it’s at. You don’t need to worry about investment performance when you can complain about government debt levels, blame the Fed for doing away with free markets, and rail against politicians all day long.

Just keep reading Zero Hedge. That oughta fix everything.

**7. Benchmark your portfolio to the best-performing asset class.** Who cares about diversification when there is always one asset class, strategy or sector outperforming?

Spend your days second-guessing that you don’t have more money invested in the asset class with the best short-term performance. Then take all of your money and invest it in the best performer.

Simply repeat this strategy over and over again.

It has to work eventually, correct?

**8. Blame the Fed when you underperform.** When you’re right it’s pure skill. When you’re wrong, it’s all the Fed’s fault.  The system would have collapsed if it hadn’t been for Greenspan, Bernanke, Yellen and Powell.

Don’t worry about introspection following a bad prediction about the end of the financial system as we know it.

You’re not wrong just early.

**9. Live and die by the short-run.** No one has time for the long-run. The sure path to riches in the markets comes from following every economic data point, earnings release, headline, financial news story and insane social media conspiracy theory.

You need to stay on top of this stuff so you can react in real-time.

It’s not like the market prices this stuff in.

**10. Sell all of your stocks in a bear market.** Bear markets are far too painful to sit through. After stocks nosedive, sell your stocks and wait for the coast to clear.

How hard can it be to pick bottoms?

**11. Assume you’re the next Warren Buffett.** The guy is from Nebraska. Just memorize some of his folksy quotes and read a book or two about his investment style.

Picking stocks is easy!

**12. Overreact to market volatility.** Volatility is scary. Panic. Change your portfolio. Abandon your asset allocation, diversification be damned.

There is no time for critical thinking. Act first, think later.

**13. Be pessimistic about everything.** Optimism is for gullible people. Everything is always bad. The world is falling apart.

What’s the point of investing in a world that’s gone to hell?

**14. Investing is boring. Just speculate!** Trade zero-days options. Gamble. Shoot the moon. The markets are rigged anyway.

Why even try?

**15. Try to become rich overnight.** Forget your goals. Delayed gratification is for losers. Take as much risk as possible to create wealth in the shortest amount of time.

SPY and SPLG are offered by State Street, a publicly traded company (STT) that is one of the 500 companies on the S&P 500. Meaning, when you purchase SPY or SPLG, you're purchasing a product and giving money to State Street and thus supporting the S&P 500. VOO, on the other hand, is offered by Vanguard, which is a private company. 

Does it make sense to purchase SPY or SPLG over VOO for this reason? The expense ratios are the only difference, as the holdings of all three are nearly identical. SPLG actually has the lowest expense ratio of the three but for most of us who aren't investing in the millions- it won't really matter anyway.

For instance, I own XYZ at $100/share. My 100 shares are worth $10,000. 

I sell a covered call with a strike price of $101, for $0.20, so $20 for the contract.

My stock goes up to $101, I make $100 capital gains, plus I made $20 on the contract. 

But I want the stock, and believe it will go up even higher, plus it yields dividends, so I’m willing to buy it back at $101.10 immediately, even though the market price is still $101.00. This way I pay $10,110 for the shares that I just sold for $10,100, but I made the $20 on the covered call, so I’m up $10. 

Can I create a chain of such sales and purchases to create passive income while maintaining my position on the stock? This seems great because my original investment was $10,000 and I wind up with something that is worth $10,100, plus the $10 profit from the whole transaction.

Payrolls downward revisions of 818,000 fewer jobs (an average of 68,167 fewer net jobs added per month) created between April 2023 and March 2024 put great pressure on the Fed to go down either 25 to 50 basis points on September 17th and 18th as the previous rosy picture of employment was overblown.

This will likely cause Powell to be less hawkish on the outlook and the Fed has to pivot speedier to ensure a soft landing instead of a recession.

Currently, there is a 69.5% likelihood of a 25 basis-points interest rate cut by the Fed in September, with a 30.5% chance of a super-sized 50 bps cut.  It is 69.5% +30.5% = 100% of probable rate cut in September, and the revision should only increase the 50 bps of 30.5% even higher.

Walmart told CNBC the decision to sell its stake will allow the company to “focus on our strong China operations for Walmart China and Sam’s Club, and deploy capital towards other priorities.”

The company said “JD has been a valued partner to us over the past 8 years, and we are committed to a continued commercial relationship with them.”

The stock was the largest loser on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index. The U.S.-listed shares fell 9.5% in after-hours trading.

54,2024-08-21,32,"Macy’s cuts sales forecast as department stores struggle to draw shoppers  Macy’s cut its full-year sales forecast Wednesday, as the department store operator said it is contending with selective shoppers and more promotions.

The retailer posted a mixed quarter, as it topped Wall Street’s earnings expectations but missed on revenue.

Macy’s said it now anticipates net sales of between $22.1 billion and $22.4 billion, which is lower than the $22.3 billion to $22.9 billion range it had previously anticipated. That also would be a year-over-year decline from the $23.09 billion it reported in fiscal 2023.

Macy’s expects comparable sales, which take out the impact of store openings and closures, to range from a decrease of about 2% to a decline of about 0.5%. It had previously expected comparable sales to range from a decline of about 1% to a gain of 1.5%. That metric includes owned and licensed sales, which encompasses merchandise that Macy’s owns and items from brands that pay for space within its stores, along with Macy’s third-party online marketplace.

The department store operator said in a news release that the new outlook range “gives the flexibility to address the ongoing uncertainty in the discretionary consumer market.”

Here’s what Macy’s reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 53 cents adjusted vs. 30 cents expected

Revenue: $4.94 billion vs. $5.12 billion expected

Shares fell about 8% in premarket trading.

The iconic department store is pushing to get back to steadier footing and sustained growth. Spring announced in February that the retailer would shutter about 150 – or nearly a third – of its namesake stores and invest in the roughly 350 locations that remain. It plans to close the locations by early 2027. 

It is also opening new, smaller Macy’s stores in suburban strip malls and adding new locations of its better-performing brands, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury.

Yet Macy’s results in the recent quarter revealed its struggles to pull off that comeback at a time when consumers have been pickier about purchases – especially items that are wants rather than needs. 

Net sales fell from $5.13 billion in the year-ago period.

The namesake Macy’s brand continued to be the company’s weakest performer. Comparable sales fell 3.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including the third-party marketplace. 

At Bloomingdale’s, comparable sales declined 1.4% on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including the third-party marketplace. And Bluemercury comparable sales rose 2%, marking the 14th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth for the beauty brand.

In the three-month period that ended Aug. 3, Macy’s net income was $150 million, or 53 cents per share, compared with a loss of $22 million, or 8 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

Macy’s stressed it has made progress in its turnaround plan, which it unveiled in February soon after Spring stepped into the company’s top role. At the first 50 of its stores to get additional investment, comparable sales were up 1% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. It marked the second consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales at those stores since the plan started.

Yet even when excluding the weaker stores that Macy’s is shutting, sales were lackluster. Comparable sales for its go-forward namesake brand – which includes the Macy’s stores that will remain open and online sales – declined 3.3% on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including the third-party marketplace. 

Along with a choppy sales environment, Macy’s leaders had also faced a bid by an activist group to take the company private. Macy’s said last month that its board had unanimously decided to end negotiations with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital.

Shares of Macy’s closed on Tuesday at $17.74, bringing the company’s market cap to $4.9 billion. As of Tuesday’s close, the company’s stock is down about 12% so far this year. That trails behind the approximately 17% gains of the S&P 500 during the same period.

63,2024-08-21,23,"Target beats on earnings and revenue, but gives cautious sales outlook for the year   Target said Wednesday that sales grew about 3% in its fiscal second quarter, a return to growth after a prolonged stretch of sluggish sales and squeezed profits.

The discounter beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue expectations, as shoppers made more visits to Target’s stores and website and bought more discretionary items like clothing.

Even so, the company stuck by its previous full-year sales forecast and struck a cautious note. Target said it expects comparable sales for the full year to range from flat to up 2%, but said it now expects the increase will likely be in the lower half of the range. 

Target raised its profit guidance, however, saying it expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $9 to $9.70, up from the previous range of $8.60 and $9.60.

Shares rose more than 10% in premarket trading as Target showed improvement in generating profits.

On a call with reporters, Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke said Target took a “measured approach” with its outlook because it’s hard to predict consumers’ mindsets and the state of the economy in the coming months.

“While we’ve been pleased with our performance so far this year, and our view of the consumer remains largely the same, the range of possibilities and the macroeconomic backdrop in consumer data and in our business remains unusually high,” he said.

Here’s what Target reported for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.57 vs. $2.18 expected

Revenue: $25.45 billion vs. $25.21 billion expected

Target, known for its wide array of trendy but low-priced merchandise, has been hurt as consumers buy fewer items like new outfits or home decor while they pay more for everyday expenses like food and housing. The big-box retailer has also struggled with reduced profits in recent quarters, as customers bought items like groceries that tend to be lower margin, and losses from damaged inventory and theft, including organized retail crime, took a toll.

Those trends improved in the second quarter, as Target attracted shoppers with new merchandise and reduced prices.

Target’s net income jumped to $1.19 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $835 million, or $1.80 per share, in the year-ago quarter. That’s a more than 40% year-over-year increase.

Total revenue rose from $24.77 billion in the prior year.

Comparable sales rose 2% in the quarter, the first time in five quarters that Target posted a gain. The industry metric tracks sales online and at stores open at least 13 months.

Digital sales drove most of those gains, growing 8.7% in the quarter, as more customers used same-day services like curbside pickup and home delivery. Comparable store sales rose slightly, up 0.7%.

Target has tried to rev up sales and drive higher foot traffic by deepening loyalty and offering discounts. The company relaunched its loyalty program early this year and introduced a new paid membership, Target Circle 360, that includes perks like free same-day deliveries. Target threw its own sales event in July to compete with Amazon’s Prime Day. And it announced in May that it would cut prices on about 5,000 frequently bought items, including diapers, milk and paper towels. 

CEO Brian Cornell said customers have responded well to the price cuts and credited them for contributing to traffic growth in the quarter. 

Customer traffic across Target’s website and store grew 3% in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. The average size of customers’ shopping baskets, however, declined slightly, Fiddelke said.

Discretionary sales, which have been under pressure across the retail industry, improved. Target said apparel sales, for instance, grew more than 3% in the quarter compared with the year-ago period. 

Back-to-school has also been an important season for the retailer. Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on a call with reporters that the shopping season has matched Target’s expectations, as many customers gravitate toward items with good value like backpacks that cost $5 and crayons that cost 25 cents. 

He said back-to-college shopping tends to be a longer season, as students gradually decorate their apartments and dorms.

Shares of Target closed on Tuesday at $144.33. As of Tuesday’s close, the company’s stock is up about 1% so far this year. That’s trailed behind the S&P 500′s approximately 17% gains during the same period.

52,2024-08-21,27,"Alphabet share buyback & investing cash flow Alphabet has the best 'value' benchmark among the Magnificent 7 from earning multiple perspective. Accordingly to past financial reports since '22, Alphabet has been dedicating almost 100% of its free cash flow in share buyback. 

The number is huge considering that its net income in '22 is $60B, $73.8B for '23, and trailing 4 quarters is at $87.7B. Share buyback amounted to $59B, $62B, and most recently $63B.

Alphabet uses free cash flow calculation as derived by \[Cash flow from operation minus purchases in plants & equipment\]. Numbers are compiled at [http://gotrader.xyz/](http://gotrader.xyz/)

Considering that we're now in the accelerated AI era since the launch of killer app ChatGPT back in late 22, there appears to be no slowing in share buyback. I was curious given the lackluster spending of AI equipment, since protecting Alphabet's moat (i.e., dominant position in search) is more important than share buyback.

Take a look at investing cash flow. It's hovering at some $20B annually. One can presume these expenses are inclusive of its custom TPU accelerators (all other major tech companies use Nvidia's). Why don't Alphabet spend more on TPU purchases?

I'll be back in November before the 3rd (?) cut.  Healthcare REITs have taken a hit the last 3 years with a decline and I'm eyeballing some safe real estate options with the turn of the probable influx of loaning and spending - but I feel the chances of a good turn-around for this sector on top of the under-evaluation it is experiencing will bring this up as a solid investment for the institutions soon."
11,2024-08-21,6,"Big tech stock price vs market cap  So I was thinking about where big tech stock prices can go from here considering 7 stocks account for a significant portion of the US market already. It’s hard to comprehend a company that is already 7% of the total market, consistently beating the market over the long run. 

Then it hit me; With share buy backs, assuming these companies are buying back more shares than they’re paying out in comp every year (which it looks like they are), the stock prices of the major big tech companies should increase by a higher amount than their market caps do. 

A quick Google search reveals that AAPLs outstanding shares decreased 2.9% in 2022 and around similar amount in 2021. This basically a “guaranteed” 2% of annual growth on the existing shares not taking into account other factors that affect stock price?

Is there anywhere I can see a graph of a company’s market cap like you can do with stock price? I’d like to compare share price growth to market cap growth.

41,2024-08-20,10,"Eli Lilly nears all-time high on weight loss success Lilly tested its drug tirzepatide on patients with prediabetes and obesity. after three years, the patients were 94% less likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to the placebo group. In addition, they lost an average of 22.9 percent of their body weight, compared with 2.1 percent in the placebo group. These data further confirm the potential clinical benefit of long-term treatment for patients with obesity and prediabetes.

Although tirzepatide is relatively new to the market (first approved in 2022), it's already a profitable drug. Last year, it generated $5.34 billion in sales. This year, it's on track to reach nearly $18 billion in sales!

Lilly's stock is closely tied to the company's efforts to expand the use of tirzepatide. The company is testing the efficacy of tirzepatide for a variety of conditions thought to be caused by obesity, including heart disease, sleep apnea and Alzheimer's disease.

Nearly 900 million adults worldwide are at risk for complications from obesity.

Eli Lilly also advocates long-term use of tizepatide. During a 17-week follow-up period, patients stopped treatment and some began to regain weight and develop type 2 diabetes. This resulted in an overall 88% reduction in the risk of developing diabetes."
101,2024-08-20,24,"Lowe's cuts full-year outlook as it expects weaker home improvement sales  Lowe’s on Tuesday cut its full-year forecast, as the retailer’s quarterly sales declined and it projected weak home improvement spending in the second half of the year.

The company said it now projects total sales of between $82.7 billion and $83.2 billion for the full year, compared with the $84 billion to $85 billion that it previously expected. It said it expects comparable sales to fall by 3.5% to 4%, compared with its prior forecast of a decline of 2% to 3%. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share will be about $11.70 to $11.90, compared with the prior outlook of between $12 and $12.30.

In an interview with CNBC, CEO Marvin Ellison said consumers are waiting for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. He added shoppers also under pressure from the economic backdrop.

“Inflation remains high,” he said. “And big-ticket purchases are being delayed as customers sit back and wait for interest rates to fall.”

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled a rate cut could come as soon as September, but Ellison said it’s difficult to predict how soon home improvement activity would gain momentum again after that.

About 90% of Lowe’s customers are homeowners and most have a fixed 30-year mortgage rate of less than 4%, he said. That explains customers’ hesitance to get a new mortgage or take out a loan for a major home project with higher interest rate, he added.

He said Lowe’s has not seen “a dramatic shift one way or another in overall consumer sentiment,” but is waiting for housing turnover to go up.

Here’s what the company reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $4.10 adjusted vs. $3.97 expected

Revenue: $23.59 billion vs. $23.91 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Aug. 2, Lowe’s net income fell to $2.38 billion, or $4.17 per share, compared with $2.67 billion, or $4.56 per share, in the year-ago period.

Lowe’s got a $43 million pretax gain from the sale of its Canadian retail business in 2022, which lifted its earnings in the second quarter. That boosted the company’s earnings per share in the period by 7 cents. Excluding the gain, the company earned $4.10 per share.

Net sales dropped from $24.96 billion in the prior year. Lowe’s posted a year-over-year sales decline for the sixth straight quarter.

Comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out one-time factors like store openings and closures, dropped 5.1%, as the company said customers took on fewer discretionary home projects and unfavorable weather hurt sales of outdoor and seasonal items. It said those declines were partially offset by growth in its online business and sales to home professionals, such as contractors and electricians.

Lowe’s shared its quarterly results and outlook at a time when investors and economists are watching consumer spending particularly closely. Recent economic data and corporate earnings have given mixed indications about American households’ financial health, as the Federal Reserve weighs a much-awaited rate cut.

Jobs growth in July came in much lower than expected. Yet on the other hand, Walmart’s CFO, John David Rainey, told CNBC that the largest U.S. retailer does not “see any additional fraying of consumer health.” Goldman Sachs also cut the odds of a recession to 20%.

For home improvement retailers, the strain may be greater because of higher mortgage rates and elevated costs for borrowing. Lowe’s rival, Home Depot, last week beat Wall Street’s quarterly expectations for earnings and revenue. Yet the company said it expects the back half of the year to be weaker than anticipated as consumers continue to have a “deferral mindset.”

In an interview with CNBC, Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said customers are not only putting off projects because of higher interest rates. He said they also have “a sense of greater uncertainty in the economy,” even though most of Home Depot’s customers own homes and have seen sharp property value gains.

Shares of Lowe’s closed Monday at $243.21. As of Monday’s close, the company’s stock is up about 9% year to date, trailing behind the nearly 18% gains of the S&P 500.

309,2024-08-19,67,"AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stock Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia.

AMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.

The computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.

“AI systems are our number one strategic priority,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.

The addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.

“The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,” Su said.

AMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.

AMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.

ZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD’s data center chief, Forrest Norrod.

The closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.

Executives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company’s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company’s customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.

AMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company’s adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

Seven & i has set up a committee to consider the proposal, following the guidance set out by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade & Industry.

66,2024-08-18,44,"Deep dive into Chegg - A turnaround story or a company in freefall? **1.0 Introduction**

Chegg ($CHGG) began as a textbook rental service, ***a*****iming to reduce the high costs of purchasing textbooks**. Over time, it evolved into a company that offers **a** **range of educational services and tools**.

The education system has plenty of flaws, creating demand for individuals and companies to assist in understanding a certain topic. There are plenty of amazing sources of knowledge, ranging from *Coursera* and *edX* to *Udacity* and even *YouTube*. However, they **do not offer a solution to the homework**, but rather an understanding of a certain topic.

This is where Chegg comes in. Its primary business is **selling students monthly subscriptions for homework help.** So, is Chegg a ***net positive*** for society?

**Although it can be used for learning, I’d argue that it is an organization that supports academic dishonesty and acts as a cheating database for homework.**

Some universities request data from Chegg to monitor their students and prevent cheating during exams. Chegg provides this information, including *activity timestamps, IP addresses,* and *email details*, which universities use to identify and suspend students involved in misconduct.



**2.0 The pandemic surge & the beginning of the end**

As expected, Chegg benefited from the pandemic, and the number of subscribers doubled between 2019 and 2021 (from 3.9 million to 7.8 million).

However, the beginning of the end has started, and it can be best illustrated through the following 5 points:



**2.1 The competitive landscape is significantly different**

Given the alternatives that exist today for solving homework problems, it is unlikely that the company will return to its growing days.

ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, although the revenue decline already started in Q2-2022. Based on the last quarterly report (Q2-2024), the revenue is **declining at a rate of 10% per year.** Its revenue is down from $776m back in 2021, to $683m for the last twelve months (ending June 2024).

It is not only ChatGPT, there’s *Caktus AI, Jenni AI, Numerade, Photomath, Course Hero, and many more.*

Google Trends paints a great picture of how the demand for Chegg has changed in the last 5 years.

  
**2.2** **Being profitable is a challenge**

Except for the pandemic period, the company is struggling to find its way to operating profitability, despite the \~70% gross margin. If we add up the operating profit / (loss) of the last 7 years (*which includes the pandemic boost*), the company broke even.

With more competitors, lower demand, and decreasing revenue, it is difficult to make a case that Chegg is a company that will turn things around. It appears that Chegg’s best days are behind it, and the only way to survive longer - is by cutting costs.

Back in April, the company announced Nathan Schultz as the new CEO, and a restructuring plan was shared with the public. Part of the plan was reducing its global headcount by 23% which will lead to **$40-$50m** in savings as of 2025. This is a great decision when facing declining revenue. However, on its own, it is not enough to create long-term shareholder value. It is unclear how the management plans to reinvent the company with fewer employees.

  
**2.3 Poor capital allocation**

The previous management has a terrible record in capital allocation.

We can best illustrate that through the balance sheet of the company between the end of 2017, and June 2024:

||December 2017|June 2024|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cash, short-term, and long-term investments|$229m|$605m|
|Debt|$0|$617m|
|Net cash|$229|-$11|
|Shares outstanding|110m|104m|

Despite generating \~$1.3 billion in operating cash flow in this period, the company’s net cash position has decreased by $240m.

So, where did this **\~$1.5 billion go to?**

1. Acquisitions - **$600 million** (Busuu, Mathway, Thinkful, StudyBlue, WriteLab, Math42)
2. Capex - **$550 million**
3. Share buybacks (net of issuance) - **$200 million**

In Q2-2024, the company reported **$481m in impairments** (mostly in goodwill) - meaning they significantly overpaid for the past acquisitions, especially Busuu *(acquired for $436m).*



**2.5** **Terrible reviews**

The reviews of the company have been terrible. (Source: Trustpilot)

Recently, there have been more accusations of customers with difficulties canceling their memberships or having been charged multiple times after they canceled the subscription. The revenue the company reported is likely somewhat inflated and will continue to decrease in the quarters to come.



**3.0 Valuation**

Based on the above analysis, Chegg is a company with decreasing revenue and a low chance of finding a way to grow and become profitable. With that in mind, the value of the company is its liquidation value (which **IS NOT** its book value).

Based on my estimates, its liquidation value is around \~$160m (not that far from its market cap of $212m). Therefore, I do think the market is not expecting it to be a turnaround story.

**Could the market be wrong?** Of course!

1. Given the competitive landscape and the 23% employee reduction, as mentioned above, I struggle to envision a path, where the company reinvents itself and increases the number of subscribers. However, there is always a chance that a miracle happens, despite this chance being very low. With the restructuring plan in place, at least the company can survive for many years to come.
2. The company could get acquired for its customer base. The typical acquisition premium is around 20%, so the 7.7 million subscribers would have an average price of \~**$33**. I do think acquisition is a more likely scenario than bankruptcy.

I need some advice on what I should do with ETSY, SQ, AFRM, and PYPL. I bought these stocks 2-3 years ago thinking they’d be a good investment but now am having second thoughts. I’ve got quite a bit of money tied up between these stocks. 

Should I just realize my losses and write it off on my taxes and use the money to buy VTI? Or do you guys think I should continue to hold maybe eventually making a profit on them?

Any advice would be fantastic for I am still very young and dumb lol (24 y/o)

693,2024-08-18,322,"Starbucks. New CEO. As many of you probably already knows, SB is getting a new CEO. Who is the CEO of Chipotle. But do you know exactly what the new CEO will be getting?

SB released their 8-K filing, which outlines the CEO's offer letter.

to quickly break it down, and its a crazy .... (this isnt all of it... i just stopped reading after a bit)

**Salary**

* base salary is $1.6mm/yr
* reviewed annually. may be increased in discrection of the board
* base salary may not be decreased without CEO's express written consent.

**Annual incentive**

* annual cash bonus with target of **225% of base salary and max of 450% of base salary**. Meaning he gets a bonus of anywhere $3.6mm to $7.2mm... if he does SHIT performance for 1 year, he is still guaranteed $3.6mm...


**Long Term Incentive Plan**

* Starting 2025, Grant of $23mm. vesting 25% / year. (im not 100% sure, but i believe he gets a new grant every year.)

**Signing bonus**

* $10mm signing bonus. a sign on bonus thats 6.25x his base salary

**Replacement Grant**

* Receive a grant of Company equity for leaving Chipotle
* (has a calculation to determine how much CEO will receive in the event of leaving SB. regardless, its a SHITLOAD) in the $75mm to $80mm range.

**Termination**

* Has severance plan.
* if he gets terminated, he gets an insane severance plan. Literally enough that even if he didnt have any compensation/salary/Stocks, his severance plan will be enough for him to retire on

**Executive life insurance**

* family coverage
* equal to 3x annualized based salary. Fully covered by SB
* pay purchase additional 2x annualized base salary up to max additional LI of $2mm.

(SB states ""As an executive, you and your family have a greater exposure to financial loss resulting from your death. Starbucks recognizes this exposure and has
provided for coverage greater"". So i guess his 1 year TC of $10mm+, along with his $10mm signing bonus is not enough for his family in the untimely possibility of his death. SB gives him even MORE additional coverage (which SB pays for) for LI.)


**Executive Physical Exam**

(gets special treatment for physical exams. Looks like everyone on the executive team does)

**Work location**

(SB PAYS him to be 100% remote work. gives him his own assistance and full personal office. which SB will also provide and pay for, for maintenance)

* Not required to relocated to HQ (Seattle, WA)
* from start date until procurment of secondary residence in Seattle (up to 3 months)
SB will cover temp housing and provide a driver while in seattle
* If decided to relocated to Seattle, WA, eligible for reimbursement for relocation expenses

**Work conditions**

* starting from the Start Date. company will provide a full remote office for work in Cali.
* provide assistance of CEO's choosing.
* Office will be maintained at expense of SB


Lastly, as CEO, he will be reporting directly to the Board. but get this. he will be appointed to the board of directors as Chairman. (which is usually standard, but still crazy... you report to... yourself)"
541,2024-08-17,300,"How common is insider trading really? When I consider the millions of publicly traded companies worldwide, the countless accounting firms involved, and the myriad CFOs, CEOs, and board members—along with their spouses—it's hard not to wonder if it's naive to believe that insider trading is only a minor issue. The temptation must be enormous. Think about it: Analysts' targets are public, you already know whether you'll beat expectations or not, and it wouldn't be difficult to find someone on the other side of the world to execute trades on your behalf. Payments could be made in crypto, gold, freaking wine bottles or whatever. The opportunity to exploit earnings information seems so staggeringly easy and potentially lucrative that it's almost impossible to believe—given human nature—that this isn't happening far more frequently than we know."
0,2024-08-17,7,"Tracking activist investors?  Activist / dissident shareholders have dramatic advantages over retail shareholders (e.g., more resources, research, the ability to meet with executives privately and glean material information). In proxy fights, the big funds (Elliott, starboard, etc.) seem to either win through gaining direct board representation or force the company to make so many shareholder-oriented concessions that they win by fiat. Their engagements almost never results in no actions taken by the companies at all. 

Given that these engagements are all public, and almost invariably result in wins for hedge funds, does it make sense for retail investors to piggyback on activist investors? Has anyone had success doing this? And are there websites or public databases that track funds’ current engagements / board seats?

9,2024-08-17,9,"NHC: Small cap nursing home stock **Intro and background info**

National Healthcare Corporation (NHC) owns and operates skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities (SNFs and ALFs).  NHC is based in Tennessee and most of their facilities are in Tennessee and nearby states.  

The pandemic and its effects were catastrophic for the nursing home industry and NHC.  In 2020, excess deaths in the 85+ age bracket were [well over 25%](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-p-scores-average-baseline-by-age?showSelectionOnlyInTable=1&country=~USA) of expected deaths and continued to remain elevated until early 2023.  The increase in deaths caused occupancy rates to plummet and the number of vacant beds doubled for NHC in 2021.

And just when the death rate was beginning to approach normal levels, the labor shortage worsened.  Immigration to the USA was restricted in 2020-21 due to the pandemic.  This caused a severe labor shortage that peaked in 2022, with 12 million total US job openings.  Wage inflation exceeded 6% for most of 2022 & 2023. The elderly care industry was especially hard hit because it is a labor intensive industry.  NHC was forced to extensively use expensive staffing agencies & traveling nurses to fill vacancies.

Occupancy rates and labor balance are only now starting to approach pre-2020 baseline levels.  Because of this, the stock price has already increased sharply.  I first wrote about NHC [here in April 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bspx41/increasing_dementia_will_be_a_long_term_boon_for/).  Since then, the price has increased by 38% in 4 months.  But there are still multiple factors and trends that will improve margins and accelerate earnings growth.

**1. The labor situation will continue to improve**

Goldman Sachs estimates that the net immigration rate to the United States is currently +160K/month or +2 million/year.  Many of these new immigrants will compete for entry level positions like housekeeper and caregiver, which will decrease wage pressure and turnover.  Also, nursing shortages are continuing to ease.  Nursing job postings on Indeed are down [30% from 2022 peak levels](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPNURS).  NHC reported a 57% year on year (YoY) decrease in staffing agency utilization.  Traveling nurses are incredibly expensive and NHC will continue to see a decreasing need for them.  NHC reported a net YoY total salaries/wages increase of only 2.7% in the most recent quarter.  It’s reasonable to expect that YoY changes in total salaries/wages will continue to decrease.

**2. Occupancy and Demand will continue to increase**

Occupancy rates at NHC are 89%, which is very near pre-2020 baseline levels of around 90%.  But occupancy rate will likely continue to increase and exceed 90% in the coming quarters because there is an increasing supply & demand imbalance of senior living facilities including SNFs.  Because of the 2020-2023 headwinds, intensive construction of senior living facilities stopped.  Meanwhile, demographic changes continue as the first baby boomers approach 80 years old.  Increasing occupancy & demand will not only increase resident volume, it will allow NHC to become more selective and allow them to select the more profitable Medicare and Privately insured residents.

**3. Insurance reimbursement rates will continue to increase**  

Because of the current and projected demand increases, insurance has been forced to increase reimbursement rates.  Before 2020, Medicare’s annual rate increase was normally around 2%.  In July 2023, Medicare announced a rate increase of 4.0%.  In July 2024 they announced another 4.2% increase that will take effect in October of this year.  Annual Medicaid increases were sometimes below 1% pre-2020.  NHC recently reported its 2024 YTD Medicaid reimbursement rates have already increased 5.0%.  And new, significant Medicaid increases started in July for Tennessee and South Carolina.  These increases will contribute to earnings in upcoming quarters.



**Conclusion and positions**

For the most recent quarter, NHC reported normalized earnings growth of 12.4% vs Q2 2023.  I think that earnings growth is likely to accelerate in coming quarters.  I'd appreciate any feedback.  What other related stocks are you all following?

4,2024-08-17,7,"A tale of two REITs At the time I bought them, AMT and CCI were the leaders in the multiple tenant cellular communications space. Over the past few years AMT has doubled in price while CCI has lost ground, trading within 10% of my purchase price. 

AMT is doing well domestically with investments in expanding the company in India facing growing competition and exchange rate risk from high Indian inflation.

CCI income is primarily from US/North America with its fiber backbone segment not performing as expected since 2021. 

Both companies stand to benefit from falling interest rates and expanding demand for 5G coverage so those are not discriminators for comparison. 

Both are affected by M&A in the telecom space that give a small number of large players more leverage in negotiating lease agreements. 

What do you think of these businesses? Would you buy either at Friday's closing price?

Personal: My cost basis makes my ROI on AMT North of 5% after taxes. CCI is more problematic with activist investors acquiring shares lately.

18,2024-08-17,8,"American Healthcare REIT (AHR) increased senior living, Recent IPO, Low Interest, Under Evaluation and effects of fed cuts incoming I came up with this in a short time - I'm looking for some more experienced investors to give me the negatives and possible counter points to weigh this long term. If I'm being too narrow-minded/shallow please let me know.

American Healthcare REIT (AHR) is a Real Estate Investment Trust that operates $4.5B worth of properties/assets that has a current market cap of $2.47B, I'm no financial wizard - I'm basing future outlook on under-evaluation, lower than reasonable interest (growing), the basis of their growth in America, and current investors who've bought in the last quarter.

Background: AHR IPO'd early February 2024 - at a share price of $12/sh which quickly moved to $13.5\~ increasing steadily both in volume and share price to $19 today. Besides the fact that they've beat revenue estimates the only 2/3 quarters they've been public . . .

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ahr/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ahr/earnings)

TLDR;

1. federal rate cuts in the next year or so propel REIT's forward most likely
2. senior living is peaking, AHR specializes in nursing homes, senior care etc.
3. mostly, there has been very low volume recently but continued steady growth with revenue estimates beating the first two quarter, Vanguard recently purchased \~1% ownership last month, other funds following suite slowly.
4. the current assets value surpass the market cap valuation by almost 2x,

**1. Federal Interest rate cut history and effects on REIT's**

[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-funds-rate-history/](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-funds-rate-history/)

Federal interest rate cuts come in waves historically for stretches of at least 2 years at a time, with quarterly cuts of interest rate percentage ranging from 0.25%-1% a quarter.

Mar 22' -> July 23': 0.25% up to 5.50%

Aug 18' -> Mar 20': 2.25% down to 0%

Dec 15' -> Dec 18': . 0.25% up to 2.50%

Now - current market consensus point to at least 3 cuts by December. Historically fed rate cuts have assisted in the stock price and performance of REIT's but obviously that doesn't just apply to REIT's - spending in general will increase with decreased interest and that would only grow - there is more depth to this but looking in the big picture - I take these points with probabilities along with the following but if you look into the many positive factors:

- Transactional volume returns

- cost of capital reduction

- expansions increased with rate reductions

- increased investments from income investors in REITs

**2. AHR basis of Portfolio and Increase of the average age of Americans**

AHR specializes in senior housing, nursing facilities, and senior health campuses. In the last decade the average American's age has gone from 37.2 years old to 38.9 with most recent census in 2022 - with the lowest fertility rate ever recorded in 2023, the most recent years couple deciding to not have children or waiting too long more than ever - the average age of the population will keep pushing upward, granted these effects will take a while to take effect but it has been a trend that has continued.

**3. Low but steadily increasing volume and share price**

[https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ahr-sec-filing-2024-08-13/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ahr-sec-filing-2024-08-13/)

Looking at the current volume and share price historical charts - AHR has slowly grown and garnered more interest but with shockingly low volume for daily trading. Recently Vanguard has bought almost 1% of the company's shares along with other hedge funds getting a taste. This is just some confidence to instill but my last point -

4. **AHR's current assets are much greater than their current market cap evaluation**

|| || |**TICKER**|**Market Cap**|**Total Assets**| |**AHR**|**2.47B**|**4.7B**| |WELL|70.363B|45.53B| |VTR|24.064B|24.673B| |DOC|15.007B|15.699B| |OHI|9.951B|8.85B| |CTRE|4.289B|2.34B|

[https://finance.yahoo.com/sectors/real-estate/reit-healthcare-facilities/](https://finance.yahoo.com/sectors/real-estate/reit-healthcare-facilities/)

Looking at some of the top REIT's I could find from the top - no REIT is as undervalued in comparison to their assets as AHR is. Quickly compiling the first 5 top REIT's I could find - looking at their currently held assets, they are either evaluted more or around the same as their combined assets and this varies due to how much revenue they are able to turn and how much debt they may have but with AHR - by no means should a real estate trust be valued lower than the value of their actual assets.

Mind you - I compiled this information in under 2 days. I'm here pass to pass these ideas through some bigger brains I feel like this is reasonable outlook for a long term investment but I'm looking for the counter-arguments."

38,2024-08-16,33," Potential bear scenario on $LLY $NVO and other pharma  I have been very bullish on LLY for a while due to the significant improvements I observed in the supply of GLP-1 drugs. Q2 earnings report has been very informative on this, and helped pricing in the supply improvements and the updated revenue projections.

I watched Harris&Biden speech yesterday where they spent a lot of time criticizing the big pharma for their pricing practices.

transcript: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/08/15/remarks-by-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-on-the-progress-they-are-making-to-lower-costs-for-the-american-people-largo-md/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/08/15/remarks-by-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-on-the-progress-they-are-making-to-lower-costs-for-the-american-people-largo-md/)

The whole thing was about communicating their track record on fighting big pharma, and committing to doubling down on this with Harris&Waltz. Seems like this is going to be a major piece of her campaign. One of the major messages was how Biden&Harris passed the legislation that allowed reducing the prices for 15 medicines starting from January 2026.

>Biden: ""And we’re just getting started.  Under the law I signed,  Medicare can negotiate lower prices for another 15 drugs next year, 15 the following, and 20 after that until every drug is covered.  (Applause.)  That’s the law now — now. ""

Biden cited significant wins realized with the new law. He mentioned price of one of the drugs have dropped from 400 to 35, and other drugs had price reductions between 40-80%.

Just last month, Biden&Sanders called out LLY and NVO specifically

>""If Novo Nordisk and other pharmaceutical companies refuse to substantially lower prescription drug prices in our country and end their greed, we will do everything within our power to end it for them. Novo Nordisk must substantially reduce the price of Ozempic and Wegovy,""

[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biden-says-novo-nordisk-must-cut-prices-diabetes-weight-loss-drugs-2024-07-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biden-says-novo-nordisk-must-cut-prices-diabetes-weight-loss-drugs-2024-07-02/)

Seems like Harris&Waltz has significant likelihood of winning this election, they are very committed to cutting down the pharma companies' margins significantly. The GLP-1 weight loss drugs have already attracted attention in this respect and Biden communicated a very strong message for reducing GLP-1 drug prices specifically.

All things considered, it sounds like it's time to realize the LLY gains to me. But besides that I wonder if there might be a strong bear scenario for LLY&NVO, and perhaps other pharma companies in general. LLY and NVO are trading with a very high P/E which has been driven by the long term prospects of the GLP-1 drugs. If, let's say, there is a risk of the federal government enforcing price caps on these drugs in a few years time i think it will bring down valuations of these companies significantly.

I don't have much experience in the pharma sector, so i am curious what do people think.

edit: I don't get all the down votes. My goal was to share this information so that people can assess their positions in light of this news. If you think the news is neutral to the stock then it's neutral. If there is any risks, i hope this can give people time to react before the hedge funds fully adjust their positions."
63,2024-08-16,11,"Judge temporarily blocks sports streaming service Venu, ruling in favor of Fubo TV on antitrust concerns  A U.S. judge temporarily blocked media companies Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox from launching their sports streaming service, Venu, according to court filings.

The temporary injunction, granted in response to a lawsuit brought by Fubo TV, comes just weeks ahead of the start of the NFL season. The companies had planned to launch their service by that date.

The lawsuit brought by Fubo, an internet TV bundle akin to the traditional pay TV package, had claimed Venu would upend its business.

“We respectfully disagree with the court’s ruling and are appealing it,” the companies said in a joint statement on Friday.

“We believe that Fubo’s arguments are wrong on the facts and the law, and that Fubo has failed to prove it is legally entitled to a preliminary injunction. Venu Sports is a pro-competitive option that aims to enhance consumer choice by reaching a segment of viewers who currently are not served by existing subscription options.”

Fubo’s stock was up 20% on the news of the injunction. A Fubo representative didn’t immediately comment.

Applied Materials saw the most growth in China, where sales increased 24% to $2.15 billion. China accounted for 32% of the company's sales in fiscal Q3, up from 27% in the year-earlier period.

Meanwhile, sales in Taiwan fell 15% to $1.15 billion. Sales in the South Korea advanced 12% to $1.10 billion. And sales in the U.S. rose 1% to $1.05 billion.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

0,2024-08-15,5,"Apparently, Nelson Peltz/Trian still has some or at least few Disney stocks left. How does this whole thing work? Towards the end of May 2024, it was reported that Nelson Peltz sold all of his Disney stocks:

> **Nelson Peltz Reportedly Sold All of His Disney Stock, Earning $1 Billion, After Losing Proxy Fight**
> 
> Nelson Peltz cashed out his shares of Disney shortly after the activist investor lost his bid to win seats on the Mouse House’s board, according to a CNBC report Wednesday.
> 
> Peltz sold all of his Disney stock at “close to $120 dollars a share,” making about $1 billion on the sale, CNBC reported, citing an anonymous source. That would indicate that Peltz sold the shares in the days immediately after the April 3 Disney shareholder meeting — where his bid to shake up Disney’s board was soundly defeated.
> 
> A rep for Trian Partners, the hedge fund headed by Peltz, declined to comment. Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
> 
> At the April 3 virtual meeting of Disney shareholders, investors voted to reelect the current 12-member board of directors by a substantial margin over the candidates nominated by Trian — Peltz himself and ex-Disney CFO Jay Rasulo — and a smaller investment firm, Blackwells Capital.
> 
> Peltz, in an appearance on CNBC April 4, had threatened to resume his activist agenda at Disney if the company and CEO Bob Iger did not keep their “promises.”
> 
> “I hope this is not a redo of last year where we pulled out, gave management a chance and the stock went down,” Peltz said in the CNBC interview. He added, “Whether we stay [invested in Disney] or not, we don’t make those kinds of announcements.”
> 
> Peltz’s Trian had at one time controlled 32.3 million shares of Disney, including about 30 million owned by former Marvel Entertainment head Ike Perlmutter. (Disney alleged Perlmutter harbored a longstanding personal vendetta against Iger.) At the end of 2023, Trian’s stake represented 1.8% of Disney’s outstanding shares.
> 
> In his proxy fight, one of Peltz’s biggest complaints was his allegation that Disney’s board failed to do its job with CEO succession planning in not vetting former parks boss Bob Chapek, who was Iger’s personal pick to take over the job in 2020. “They all took Bob’s word, and they voted Chapek in. That’s not what the responsibility of a director is,” Peltz said in the CNBC interview last month. The board ousted Chapek in November 2022 and brought Iger back on as CEO.
> 
> In an appearance earlier on CNBC on April 4, Iger reiterated that the Disney board’s top priority is the CEO succession and he said “they’re treating it with urgency.” He also said Disney’s long-term goal is to hit double-digit margins in the streaming business, which was another key point in Trian’s proxy campaign.

* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).

* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)

Here's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:

* “I’m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion — very very hard,” said Schmidt, adding that he’s a “close friend” to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

* “If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,” Schmidt said. “That’s not a stock recommendation.” Schmidt didn’t say if he owns Nvidia shares.

* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google’s lax work culture in the session.

* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won’t be the only winner in AI, but there aren’t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can’t spend as freely.

* “At the moment, the gap between the frontier models — there are only three — and everyone else appears to be getting larger,” Schmidt said. “Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I’m not so sure.”

* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company’s CUDA programming language. He said AMD’s software that translates Nvidia’s CUDA code for its own chips “doesn’t work yet.”

* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion. In addition to startup investing, he has been a philanthropist and advised several government committees on technology."

I work in film/media and have used Dropbox’s unlimited storage plan for more than 6 years.  It’s been great!  I’ve paid $98/month and have around 250 TB stored on their cloud. However, Dropbox is doing away with their unlimited plan.   Last year, a rep from Dropbox called me and I was informed that I would have until November of this year (2024) to remove my data or have to pay a significantly higher price.  They are now charging per 5TB.  My new price would be over $2000/month.  Obviously this is an insane increase in price and something I won’t pay and after calling today to make sure they didn’t design some sort of retention offer, which they indeed haven’t, I have begun the process of removing all my data from their cloud and storing it locally.  So the question becomes - if thousands of people like me all jump ship and leave Dropbox, how much could this affect their revenues?   Some people with unlimited plans pay more than me - as the price is based on how many users you have on your unlimited account, so there can be other users with unlimited accounts that pay $200 or  $500 or even 1000 per month, their pricing would also likely 10x or 20xI’m picturing 50k or more $100-$500/ month plans all leaving.  I’m not a stock picker and don’t usually try to make plays based on speculative things like this - but this is a situation that has peaked my interest.  I currently hold zero positions in DBX.   But curious how others might see this playing out. "

271,2024-08-15,95,"Walmart beats estimates, raises outlook as it sees stable consumer health  Walmart raised its forecast for the year on Thursday, as quarterly revenue grew nearly 5%, the company’s stores and website drew more visits and sales outside the grocery department improved. 

The discounter beat Wall Street’s expectations for sales and profits.

Walmart said it now expects sales to rise by 3.75% to 4.75% for the full year, and adjusted earnings to come in between $2.35 and $2.43 per share. It previously said it expected to be on the high end or slightly above its initial full-year guidance, which called for net sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share of between $2.23 and $2.37.

In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company’s brighter outlook reflects strength in the first half of the year. 

“We see, among our members and customers, that they remain choiceful, discerning, value-seeking, focusing on things like essentials rather than discretionary items, but importantly, we don’t see any additional fraying of consumer health,” Rainey said.

He said every month of the quarter was “relatively consistent.”

Walmart saw another promising indicator: Sales of general merchandise, such as lawn and garden supplies, were positive for the first time in 11 quarters. He said those sales were up only slightly, however. 

Here’s what the discounter reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 67 cents adjusted vs. 65 cents expected

Revenue: $169.34 billion vs. $168.63 billion

Walmart’s net income dropped to $4.5 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $7.89 billion, or 97 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue rose from $161.63 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

Comparable sales for Walmart U.S. rose 4.2% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period, which topped analysts’ expectations. The industry metric includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.

At Sam’s Club, comparable sales rose 5.2%, excluding fuel, in line with analysts’ expectations.

E-commerce sales jumped 21% globally and 22% in the U.S.

Walmart provided the latest window into the health of American households and the outlook for the broader economy as investors and economists seek clarity.

As the nation’s largest retailer, Walmart is uniquely positioned to offer insights into where the consumer is spending and scrimping. The company’s reputation for value has boosted sales over the past two years, as inflation drove more higher-income shoppers to its stores and website.

Inflation has moderated and returned to historic levels, according to July data from the U.S. Department of Labor. The consumer price index, which measures prices of a broad mix of goods and services, rose 2.9% last month compared to a year earlier. That is the lowest level since March of 2021.

Yet prices are hovering much higher than pre-pandemic, frustrating and stretching consumers. A jobs report from the Labor Department early this month also raised concerns and prompted a sharp stock market selloff, as jobs growth slowed and the unemployment rate rose more than expected.

Some companies’ earnings reports have added to worries about the economy. Home Depot on Tuesday beat quarterly expectations for earnings and revenue, but warned of slow sales in the back half of the year and consumer caution, even among its more middle- and upper-income customer base.

Shares of Walmart closed Wednesday at $68.66. So far this year, the company’s stock is up nearly 31%, outpacing the approximately 14% gains of the S&P 500.

75,2024-08-15,32,"Alibaba shares dip 3% in premarket after earnings miss expectations despite cloud acceleration  Alibaba missed top and bottom line expectations for the June quarter of 2024 as it continues to face headwinds in its core e-commerce business amid rising competition and a cautious Chinese consumer.

Shares of Alibaba fell around 3.49% at 06:58 a.m. in premarket trade in the U.S.

Here’s how Alibaba did in the June quarter versus LSEG estimates:

Revenue: 243.24 billion Chinese yuan ($34.01billion) versus 249.05 billion yuan expected.

Net income: 24.27 billion yuan versus 26.91 billion yuan expected.

Revenue was up 4% year-on-year, while net income dropped 29% year-on-year. Alibaba said the net income fall was “primarily due to a decrease in income from operations” and “increase in impairment” from its investments.

Alibaba has been looking to reignite growth after a tumultuous 2023, when it carried out its largest-ever corporate structure overhaul. This was followed by high-profile management changes, with Eddie Wu taking over the reins as chief executive in September.

The e-commerce giant has been grappling with a cautious Chinese consumer, along with increased competition from rivals such as JD.com and Temu owner PDD.

Since taking over the reins, Wu has been trying to get Alibaba’s core China e-commerce business back on a stable footing. It’s currently going through a transition phase where the company is planning to put more focus on third-party merchants selling via its platforms — Taobao and Tmall — in China, while reducing reliance on its direct sales business.

Wu has previously said the company intends to release new monetization features for its e-commerce platforms that should return the Taobao and Tmall business back to growth toward the latter half of 2025.

In the June quarter, sales from the Taobao and Tmall group, which represents Alibaba’s China e-commerce business, fell 1% year-on-year to 113.37 billion yuan.

Meanwhile, Alibaba’s overseas online shopping businesses, such as Lazada and Aliexpress, continue to be a bright spot, with sales in the international e-commerce division up 32% year-on-year.

3110,2024-08-15,674,"Starbucks giving incoming CEO Niccol $85M in cash, stock for leaving Chipotle  Starbucks offered incoming CEO and Chair Brian Niccol a pay bump and hefty one-time awards to lure him from his prior role as chief executive at Chipotle Mexican Grill.

Niccol officially takes the reins at the embattled coffee chain on Sept. 9. As CEO, he’ll be tasked with turning around the company’s slumping sales, improving customers’ experience inside stores and figuring out what to do with its struggling China business. It’s a big undertaking — for which he will be well compensated.

Starbucks disclosed Niccol’s incoming pay plan in a filing on Wednesday. The majority of his compensation package is made up of equity that vests over time, and is based on company performance targets and other metrics. In his first year, his pay package could be worth as much as $116.8 million if the company hits its targets and it fully vests.

Niccol will be paid a base salary of $1.6 million annually, with the opportunity to earn up to $7.2 million more in cash. He’ll also be eligible for annual equity awards worth up to $23 million.

And for leaving Chipotle, Niccol will receive a $10 million cash bonus and $75 million in equity to make up for what he’s forfeiting with his departure from the burrito chain. The equity will vest over a three-to-four-year period, based on company performance and Niccol’s tenure.

“Brian Niccol has proven himself to be one of the most effective leaders in our industry, generating significant financial returns over many years,” Starbucks said in a statement. “His compensation at Starbucks is tied directly to the company’s performance and the shared success of all our stakeholders. We’re confident in his ability to deliver long-term, enduring value for our partners, customers and shareholders.”

At Chipotle, Niccol collected a $1.3 million base salary last year, with a total compensation of $22.5 million. Stock awards and options accounted for the bulk of his earnings, but he also took home a cash bonus of $5.2 million.

During his tenure at Chipotle, the stock climbed 773%, fattening the value of his overall compensation.

Niccol’s pay package is also more generous than that of his ousted predecessor, Laxman Narasimhan. His base salary was $1.3 million, with possible cash bonuses of up to $5.85 million and equity awards of $13.6 million, according to filings. In fiscal 2023, Narasimhan’s compensation was valued at $14.6 million, largely from stock awards.

Unlike Narasimhan, who was previously based in the U.K., Niccol won’t be required to relocate to Starbucks’ headquarters in Seattle.

545,2024-08-14,63,"Cisco cutting 7% of workforce, reports earnings and revenue beat for quarter  Cisco shares popped 6% in extended trading on Wednesday after the networking company said it’s cutting 7% of its global workforce and reported quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates.

Here are the key numbers:

Earnings: 87 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 85 cents per share estimate, adjusted, according to LSEG.

Revenue: $13.64 billion vs. $13.54 billion estimate, according to LSEG.

Cisco said in a filing that it’s implementing a restructuring plan that will result in $1 billion in pre-tax charges to its financial results and will “allow it to invest in key growth opportunities and drive more efficiencies in its business.” 

Sales fell 10% in the fiscal fourth quarter from $15.2 billion a year earlier, Cisco said in a press release. It’s the third straight quarterly drop in revenue and the first time the company has reported a decline for a full fiscal year since 2020.

The slide is projected to last for one more period. For the first quarter, Cisco said it expects revenue of $13.65 billion to $13.85 billion, down from $14.7 billion in the prior year. Analysts were expecting $13.7 billion, according to LSEG.

Cisco said in previous quarters that the revenue slippage stemmed from certain clients setting up equipment that they’d received in previous periods.

While the downward trajectory has continued, Cisco outperformed expectations with the help of increased subscription revenue from the $28 billion acquisition of Splunk, which closed in March and was the company’s biggest deal ever.


Cisco’s core networking business, which includes switches and routers, has been in decline since large enterprises started moving to the cloud years ago. The company has bolstered its software and securities business to diversify and bring in more recurring subscription revenue.

Shares of Cisco were down 10% this year, prior to the close, while the Nasdaq was up about 14%.

67,2024-08-14,51,"Deep dive into Dutch Bros ($BROS) **1.0 Introduction**

Dutch Bros ($BROS) is capturing the attention of many with its impressive location growth.

What started as a small pushcart selling espresso drinks back in 1992, expanded to a chain with over 900 locations, posing the question: ***Is it the next Starbucks?***



**2.0 The Secret To Its Success**

Unlike the competitors, over ***90% of the business is conducted through drive-thru***, allowing it to operate using smaller (in size) shops.

* 50% of all the revenue comes from the sale of coffee;
* 25% from energy drinks (including its own proprietary Blue Rebel), and;
* 25% from other beverages (teas, lemonades, sodas, and smoothies).

Since 2008, the company has transitioned to an internal franchising model that required potential franchisees to have worked for the company for **at least three years**. Although this leads to fewer locations, it leads to better quality, which is best reflected in the number of closed locations. 

Over the last 5 years, **only one location was permanently closed** (back in 2021). Today, roughly 1/3 of all the locations are franchises.

The management expects a more capital-efficient market entry process that will begin to deliver a stronger new shop return after 2025. The different types of shops give the company greater flexibility to match the market needs in a certain area.



  
**3.0 The Potential Growth Drivers**

There are 3 ways the company’s topline will grow over time:

**3.1 Number of locations**

The management’s long-term target **is 4,000+** locations (vs. 912 locations as of June 2024). At the current pace of \~160/year, there are 2 decades of growth ahead.

This target represents roughly 10% of the total locations of Starbucks, which indicates:

1. The management intends the company to remain focused on certain key markets.
2. There are no plans for international expansion.

***The number of new locations has been growing over time:***

2018: **36 new locations**

2019: **42**

2020: **71**

2021: **97**

2022: **133**

2023: **160**

H1-2024: **81**

This means likely the target of 4,000+ locations will likely take 10-15 years to reach (instead of 20).

In my opinion, **Duch Bros isn’t the next Starbucks**, for the following reasons:

1. Dutch Bros has a different business model leveraging drive-thrus.
2. The management has no intention (currently) to grow to the size of Starbucks.

Once it reaches maturity, the excess cash flow generated will likely be used to buy back shares and/or dividends.

**3.2 New product introduction**

In theory, introducing new products could lead to higher revenue per location. Based on the historical data, it is quite clear that this isn’t the case. The average revenue per location has been growing **more or less in line with inflation**. This means the sales coming from the new products introduced cannibalize the sales of the existing products.

**3.3 Inflation**

Although not in control of the company, inflation plays a role in its costs and will eventually be passed on to the consumers.

  
Therefore, for my estimate for the future revenue growth, I take into account the growth in the number of stores, and inflation.

  
**4.0 The Historical Financial Performance**

Let’s take a look at the fun stuff. The revenue growth is definitely there, from $238m back in 2019 to $1.1b for the last twelve months (ending June 30th, 2024). However, the margins are a bit unstable.

There was a big drop due to Covid-19 when the demand was temporarily reduced. But the management cited two more reasons:

1. Increase in rent; and

2. Increase in direct costs (related to beverage, food, and packaging)

Since 2022, the gross margin has been stable (\~25%), but its operating margin has increased by 8%. The main reason behind it is - **Economies of scale**

The SG&A as % of revenue continues to decrease, leading to significant margin expansion. The management is targeting **30% Adjusted EBITDA**, which translates to **\~18%** **operating margin**.

For comparison, this is slightly higher than the operating margin of Starbucks of 16%.



**5.0 Valuation**

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is close to $5 billion (**$32/share**), not that far from today’s price ($29/share).

The revenue assumption has already been explained above. Based on my input, there will be a bit over 3,300 stores in 10 years. Combined with inflation, that leads to revenue increase of almost 400%.

As for the operating margin, I do think the management is overly optimistic, and the 18% operating margin is a stretch. For that reason, in my model, I’ve used **16% which is more in line with its mature competitors.**



Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:

|Revenue / Operating margin|14%|16%|18%|CAGR (Revenue)|# of locations|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|342% ($5.0b)|$24,0|$29,0|$33,8|***16,0%***|***3,000***|
|394% ($5.5b)|$26,7|$32,3|$37,6|***17,3%***|***3,352***|
|416% ($5.8b)|$27,8|$33,7|$39,2|***17,8%***|***3,500***|

As I’m writing this, the share price is \~$29, meaning **for Dutch Bros to be undervalued**, it needs to **increase the number of locations to at least 3,000** in the next decade and increase its **operating margin to at least 16%.**

If the management delivers the guided margin expansion to 18%, the fair value today is **over $35/share.**

I hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.

Edit: It appears INTC sold 38.5 million additional shares for $40.84 per share in June 2023, so Grandma is down 65% if she bought some shares at that time, current buyers can get 3 shares for the price of 1 at that time: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mbly/insider-activity"
235,2024-08-14,74,"Intel sells stake in UK chip designer Arm amid company-wide restructuring and cost cuts   Intel has sold its 1.18 million share stake in British chip firm Arm Holdings, according to a regulatory filing, as the California chip designer shores up its balance sheet amid intense competition. 

The sale, disclosed on Tuesday, likely raised Intel nearly $147 million, based on Arm’s average stock price between April and June.

Intel had cash and cash equivalents of $11.3 billion, and liabilities of about $32 billion at the end of June, according to its latest financials.

The divestment from Arm comes amid a tumultuous financial period for Intel, as it undergoes what CEO Pat Gelsinger has called “the most substantial restructuring of Intel since the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago.” 

At the start of August, Intel announced a $10 billion cost-reduction plan that will see it cut around 15,000 employees, eliminate its fiscal fourth-quarter dividend and reduce capital expenditures.

At the same time, Intel had reported worse-than-expected quarterly results and issued a light guidance for the current period. The results were followed by the largest single day drop in Intel’s stock price in 50 years, down 26%.

The chip firm, which both designs its own chips as well as manufactures them, has been struggling to keep up with other semiconductor competitors amid intensifying competition due to the AI boom. 

According to Gelsinger, the company’s latest losses were compounded by its decision to more rapidly produce its Core Ultra PC chips which are build to handle AI workloads. 

Competitors such as AMD and Qualcomm have also been racing to roll out more AI-focused chips, chasing the success of Nvidia. 

Under Gelsinger, the company is also looking to grow its struggling chip foundry business, and wrestle back market share lost to Taiwan’s dominant TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung in recent years.

Intel and Arm declined to comment on the sale when contacted by CNBC on Wednesday.

Intel, which has lost nearly 60% of its stock value so far this year, was slightly up in after-hours trading, according to LSEG data.

Arm’s shares have been performing well since its IPO last September, up nearly 65% year to date. 

Japan’s SoftBank Group has a majority stake in Arm, and has been a beneficiary of the jump in the company’s shares.

6,2024-08-14,4,"part 3 : LETF long terms performance over 100 years This is the third and last part, here is the links for the two previous parts:

[part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1es4jgh/part_2_letf_long_terms_performance_100_years/)

The long-term return outperforms only slightly the S&P 500 Price Return (without reinvested dividends).

In the following graph, we compare the S&P 500 Total Return (with gross dividends reinvested) and the reconstructed CL2 between 1988 and 2024.

https://preview.redd.it/ljvr9mxgglhd1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=383b706fb3112ec05121bb853ffa7a456ea6f9c4

We observe that once again, the CL2 outperforms the S&P 500 Total Return over the period. However, the volatility is significantly higher in the case of the LETF.

We can also compare the performance between 1988 and 2024 of a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy in CL2 and a DCA strategy in an index that replicates the S&P 500 Total Return. On the y-axis, we have the multiplicative value. For example, if one had invested €10 per month since 1988, the total would be €10,000 in 2015 (i.e., 1,000 times €10), or €100,000 if one had invested €100 per month (€100 × 1,000).

https://preview.redd.it/414ispplglhd1.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=76fa6d1a619f61e0e23425c73eacba182f4ad8dd

In the end, the CL2 has not been very good; it is much more volatile than the S&P 500 Total Return and underperforms it for many years. This raises the question of whether there might be a smarter way to invest than simply putting money into CL2 alone. The next section will explore this possibility.

 

# Summary of the CL2 model

In conclusion, we were able to model the CL2 return over the period 1928-2024. However, the assumptions made for the dates prior to 1999 are not reliable, so this period is only indicative. The period from 1999-2024 is much more reliable, and the model can be trusted with greater confidence.

The first observation is that over the long term CL2 has not been catastrophic and did not drop to zero. Therefore, leveraged ETF makes a conceivable option in a long-term investment strategy. However, we observe that the performance of the CL2 is close to, or worse than, the S&P 500 total return, with significantly higher volatility. This raises the question of whether buying CL2 is a worthwhile strategy for the long term. In the following section, we will explore some initial thoughts on a strategy involving CL2.

# Dollar Cost Average (DCA) strategy with a LETF

This is not investment advice. The information provided here is neither a recommendation nor an offer to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any particular strategy.

After estimating the performance of Amundi's LETF CL2 back to 1928, we can consider a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy using such an ETF.

We have observed that when interest rates are high, the performance of the CL2 is diminished. This observation leads to the following thought: Why not invest in a LETF when interest rates are low?

The idea is straightforward: if interest rates are low, we invest our DCA amount in CL2. If rates are too high, we invest the DCA amount in an index replicating the S&P 500 Total Return.

In other words, if the interest rate paid by the LETF (the €STR) is below a certain threshold x%, we invest the monthly savings in CL2. Otherwise, we invest in an index that replicates the S&P 500 Total Return in dollars.

There could be many other strategies, such as selling CL2 when interest rates are high, or allocating a percentage of monthly savings to CL2 based on interest rates. However, here we will focus solely on this particular strategy.

To find the optimal interest rate threshold at which to switch investments from CL2 to the S&P 500 in dollars, I considered a monthly DCA of a fixed amount between 1988 and 2024 (since I do not have S&P 500 Total Return data before 1988).

I conducted several simulations over the period 1988-2024, varying the interest rate threshold that triggers the switch in investment. For each simulation, I calculated the average daily return 𝜇 and the daily standard deviation 𝜎 for the portfolio. From these 𝜇 and 𝜎 values, I calculated the ratio 100 µ / 𝜎. This ration 100 µ / 𝜎 represents the return μ relatively to the risk taken (the volatility σ). The goal is to determine the interest rate threshold that maximizes this ratio.

Here are the data obtained:

https://preview.redd.it/illkt9w6hlhd1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7eab1f81f9f8480b4f0ee7f383e5207d952c13b

On the graph above for an interest rate below -0.5% per year the portfolio only contains the S&P 500 Total Return. For an interest rate above 10% per year, the portfolio only contains CL2.

We observe that to maximize μ, the portfolio should consist entirely of CL2 (although gains may not necessarily increase due to beta slippage previously discussed).

We can notice that investing in CL2 becomes riskier when the interest rate exceeds 2% per year. Therefore, an interest rate threshold of 2% per year for investing in CL2 appears to be the most optimal for the period 1988-2024. As of 03/05/2024, the borrowing cost is 4% per year.

Here is the graph comparing a DCA strategy in the S&P 500 Total Return with a DCA strategy based on the above algorithm between 1988 and 2024. On the y-axis, we have the multiplicative value. For example, if you had invested €10 per month since 1988, the total would be €10,000 in 2015 (i.e., 1,000 times €10), or €100,000 if you had invested €100 per month (i.e., €100 × 1,000).

https://preview.redd.it/sjo3mrmahlhd1.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=85b6638aff3fc38c8c7900a104659a82fee655ea

The main issue with the 2% per year interest rate threshold is that our DCA strategy would not have invested in CL2 before 2009. Since 2009, the market has been highly bullish, and CL2 has inevitably outperformed. Therefore, the threshold value of 2% per year needs to be reconsidered, as it is influenced by the bullish market of the last fifteen years. In reality, the period from 1988 to 2024 is too short to draw sufficiently reliable conclusions.

# Conclusion

We have examined various aspects of Leveraged ETFs (LETFs), from their mechanics and reconstruction to an initial consideration of a strategy. In conclusion, LETFs can be held over the long term and experience significant fluctuations, but there is no guarantee of outperforming the market over extended periods due to their performance being constrained by borrowing costs. In recent years (since around 2010), the S&P 500 has performed very well, and negative interest rates have allowed LETFs to achieve exceptional performance.

Consequently, many investors who focus solely on the past 15 years of performance may be biased and risk investing without adequate knowledge. The risk is that, with higher interest rates and a bearish market, a LETF could perform disastrously. I hope that the analysis of LETFs provided here has helped you better understand these financial instruments and thus invest with greater knowledge.

To conclude, holding a LETF is highly risky, and long-term performance does not guarantee market outperformance. To own one is to be fully aware of the associated risks.

Do not base your decisions solely on this article; make your own judgment. I must reiterate that I am not a financial professional but rather a curious individual who conducted a study on the subject. Therefore, I make no claims about the accuracy of the statements made. Past performance does not predict future results."

# The hidden cost of borrowing

As mentioned previously the return of a LETF is :

One can notice that we have an almost quadratic form in L, so we will plot the gain Mg as a function of L for different values of R thanks to the previous formula.

This graph summarizes the performance of different leveraged on the S&P 500 according to the borrowing interest rate. On the graph, all the curves pass through the same point at leverage 1, which represents the unleveraged index and therefore has no borrowing costs. Moreover, for R=0 , I plotted both the actual and estimated returns to once again prove that the assumption of a normal distribution for the S&P 500 is valid. We can see that if there were no borrowing costs during the period, a leverage of 3 would have been the most beneficial. However, with a borrowing interest rate of 4% per year, a leverage of 2 performs almost the same as without leverage (today the €STR is roughly 4%). Finally, a leverage of 3 turned out to be a bad idea under many different interest rates.

 However, we do not have the detailed performance of a LETF over time. The next section will therefore focus on constructing the performance of such a LETF.

# CL2 return from 1928 to 2024

# Introduction

First, I will focus on a LETF available in France (CL2) and its underlying index MSCI US Leveraged of 2  in euros. Therefore, the borrowing cost of both the index and the LETF is driven by the European central bank rate and not the FED rate. Thus in the following section I will consider the European Central bank rate. Moreover, the data I work with are in euros and not dollars. Even if this LETF is available in France the idea behind the reconstruction of the CL2 is still the same with other LETF.

In this section, I will focus on reproducing the performance of CL2 between 1928 and 2024 and explaining the assumptions made to model this performance. First, CL2 is an ETF from Amundi that attempts to replicate the MSCI USA index with a leverage of 2 in euros. The MSCI USA index includes the 610 largest US market capitalizations, making it very similar to the S&P 500. In the performance of the MSCI USA leveraged index borrowing cost (€STR) has been already taken into account.

# From 2014 to 2024

For this time interval, reconstructing the Amundi LETF is easy because we have the values of the ETF for this period provided on the Amundi website.

Here is the graph for the concerned period:

From this graph, we can actually extract the interest costs that Amundi pays to achieve its leverage. Indeed, according to the equality:

With µLETF being the daily return of the CL2 and µ the daily return of the MSCI USA index (without leverage).

Therefore, R is:

We can plot R:

Which can be compared to the €STR and EONIA (which are linked to the European central bank rate) over the same period. By comparing the two graphs we can clearly see the impact of €STR on the interest rates paid by the LETF.

# From 2001 to 2014

During this period, we do not have data for the MSCI USA leveraged x2 index or for the Amundi LETF. However, we do have data for the MSCI USA index and historical rates for €STR and EONIA. Therefore, we will reconstruct the performance of the CL2 LETF using these two data sources.

To reconstruct the Amundi LETF, we first use the performance of the MSCI USA index in euros for each trading day 𝑖 written µi​ .

Then, we will estimate the daily performance of the MSCI USA Leveraged 2 index, written 

, using the formula:

With

 Ri The €STR or EONIA rate of the day i

Ti The number of days between two consecutive trading days

Finally, we will apply annual management fees, written as 𝑓. We then denote µLETFi the estimated performance of the LETF on day 𝑖, which is calculated as follows:

We take the 252nd root because there are approximately 252 trading days per year

Thus, if an amount 𝑒 was invested in the Amundi LETF (CL2) on the first day, the amount on the 𝑁th day is:

The equation above is purely theoretical, so we will investigate how valid it is in practice. To check the validity of the formula we will plot the ratio between the actual performance of the LETF and the simulated performance. We will then adjust the management fee 𝑓 so that the ratio is as close to 1 as possible. In other words, we will plot the ratio of the true performance of the LETF to the estimated performance given by the equation above.

With management fees of 0.35% per year (𝑓=0.0035), the deviation between the model and the Amundi LETF does not exceed 0.3% over a 10-year period. This might seem surprising because the management fees listed in the CL2's KIID are 0.5% per year, suggesting that the CL2 manages to outperform its benchmark index in the long term, resulting in lower actual management fees. This outperformance can be attributed to the synthetic construction of the ETF.

There is two major conclusions from the previous graph:

1-It seems that there daily leverage reset cost for the CL2, in fact it seems to have additional gain.

2-The equation given above deviates only slightly (0.3% over 10 years) from the actual value of the Amundi CL2.

We can then extend the performance of the CL2 using the above equation back to 2001 with very good accuracy (around 0.5% accuracy in 2001).

# From 1999 to 2001

During this period, the euro still exists, but I no longer have values for the MSCI USA index. We will then use the following formula with data from the S&P 500 Total Return in euros.

We will then plot the ratio, as we did in the previous section, between 2001 and 2024. Given that the previous estimate for the period 2001-2014 was very reliable, we will assess the accuracy of the next estimations using the reconstructed Amundi LETF up to 2001. We obtain the following graph with f=1.4% per year if we take the S&P500 total return in euros:

We observe that the ratio fluctuates within a margin of approximately 5%. The fees are higher because the MSCI USA index is calculated with net dividends reinvested, while the S&P 500 Total Return is calculated with gross dividends reinvested. This tax difference is reflected in the higher *f* fees. We can then extend the CL2 back to early January 1999.

# From 1988 to 1999

During this period, the problem is that the euro did not exist, so I don’t have data for either the €STR or the euro-dollar exchange rate. Therefore, the data used for the simulation will be the S&P 500 Total Return in dollars and the effective rate of the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED). I will maintain the fees at 1.4% per year for this period.

I fully acknowledge that the approximations are significant, which means the CL2 graph deviates considerably from what it might have been. Therefore, the following graph should be used for indicative purposes only.

Here is the simulated graph of the CL2 back to 1988.

# From 1928 to 2024

For this last period, I no longer have data for the S&P 500 Total Return, but only for the S&P 500 Price Return. Therefore, we will plot the ratio between the model using the S&P 500 Price Return data in euros and the Amundi LETF between 2001 and 2024 in order to estimate the value of the management fee 𝑓 that compensates for the difference between the MSCI USA Net Return and the S&P 500 Price Return.

We find that 𝑓=−2.4% per year provides the best calibration of the curve. The fees are negative to offset the absence of dividends in the S&P 500 Price Return.

We can therefore extend the CL2 back to 1928 by using the S&P 500 Price Return in dollars with a management fee of -2.4% per year.

For the U.S. central bank rates, I used the values published up until 1954. For the period from 1928 to 1954, I utilized the FED rate values published daily by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Herald Tribune.

Here is the graph of the CL2, taking into account the period from 1928 to 1988, calculated as specified above.

The values from 1928 to 1999 can significantly deviate from reality because the data used is based on the dollar and the FED rate.

We will compare the graph above with the S&P 500 Price Return in dollars (dividends not included) over the period 1928-2024.

The long-term return outperforms only slightly the S&P 500 Price Return (without reinvested dividends).

In the following graph, we compare the S&P 500 Total Return (with gross dividends reinvested) and the reconstructed CL2 between 1988 and 2024.

# Introduction

 First, I want to clarify that this is not investment advice. The information provided does not constitute a recommendation or an offer to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any strategy. The reader should verify the accuracy of the information, and I make no commitments. Readers must form their own opinion through more in-depth research. I am not a financial professional, just an enthusiast. This text does not replace the advice that a financial advisor can provide. It is possible that the assumptions made do not reflect reality. Readers should consult multiple sources of information before making any decisions. Furthermore, I remind you that past performance is not indicative of future performance.

English is not my native language therefore I apology if I make some mistakes.

 There is lot of different opinions both positive and negative, about leveraged ETFs that replicate major stock indexes such as the S&P500 and NASDAQ for long-term investing. Here are some quotes:

Negatives:

·         ""These ETFs are not meant to be held for a long time because they quickly lose their value""

·         ""It is recommended to use these ETFs for a short period""

·          ""Leveraged ETFs embody the worst of modern finance""

Positives:

·         ""200k€ \[…\] , almost entirely in LQQ"" (LQQ = 2x leverage on Nasdaq)

·          ""As for the beta slippage introduced by the daily reset, I bet \[...\]on a positive beta slippage""

·         "" €65,000 invested 70% in CW8 and 30% in CL2” (CL2=2\*leveraged on MSCI USA)

All these opinions provide either optimistic or pessimistic views on leveraged ETFs, which can leave one uncertain about the judgment to adopt. In this study, we will analyze leveraged ETFs to better understand how they perform over the long term.

First, we will briefly present leveraged ETFs or LETFs. Then, we will analyze what volatility drag is and how to quantify it. Next, we will look into the ""hidden"" borrowing cost fees. With these aspects covered, we will attempt to model the theoretical performance of a leveraged ETF since 1928. Finally, we will discuss a strategy for using leveraged ETFs.

# Generality on leveraged ETF

A daily leveraged ETF, or LETF for (Leveraged ETF), replicates the daily performance of the underlying index with a lever factor L (often x2 or x3). For example, if the underlying index loses 2% in a day, a three time leveraged ETF would return -2% x 3 = -6%. There are various leverage factor, both positive and negative.

However, to achieve this lever, ETF issuers use financial instruments or issue loans. These two methods of obtaining leverage incur significant costs, such as loan interest or fees on financial instruments. Moreover, there is daily reset fees for synthetic replication ETFs. During the study, we will quantify these two types of fees for a leveraged ETF.

Finally, these borrowing and replication costs do not appear in the KIID (in Europe I am not sure for the US) of the ETF issuer because they are either integrated into the calculation of the replicated index (for borrowing costs) or into the tracking error (for replication costs). Only the management fees appear in the KIID.

# Volatility drag or Performance Gap

# An Initial Understanding of Volatility drag

At first glance, one might think that these ETFs outperform because they multiply the performance of indices that increases over the long term. Therefore, if the S&P 500 increases over 10 years, a leveraged ETF should perform better since a lever has been applied to it. However, it is a bit more complicated due to what is known as volatility drag (an intimidating term for a simple concept).

Since the lever has been applied daily, there is a daily reset. Thus, for a single day, the performance, without the borrowing costs is doubled for a 2-time lever. However, over a long period, the result is not necessarily doubled. This phenomenon is called volatility drag.

For example, if an index starts at 100, loses 10% on the first day, and then gains 11.1% the second day, its value will be 100 \* 0.9 \* 1.111 = 100 after two trading days. So, 0% over two days.

However, with a 2-time leverage, the ETF starts at 100, loses 20%, and then gains 22.2%. Its value would be 100 \* 0.8 \* 1.222 = 97.7 after two days. Therefore, an underperformance of 2.3%.

The consensus is that this volatility drag effect will inevitably ruin long-term investment. This is a misconception because even without leverage the volatility drag remains. In our example, the index, after losing 10%, needs to gain 11.1% to return to 100, not just 10%. This performance gap to recover what was lost is called volatility drag. The main issue with leveraged ETF is that this difference is more significant: 22.2% - 20% = 2.22% versus 11.1% - 10% = 1.11%. Moreover, volatility drag also applies to indexes without leveraged (or with a leverage of 1). Therefore, asserting that leveraged ETFs underperform in the long term solely due to volatility drag is incorrect, as every ETF also experience volatility drag even without any lever.

# Quantifying volatility drag over the Long Term

Thinking further, this difference is related to the gap between geometric and arithmetic averages. The arithmetic average is the mean of the daily performances, while the geometric average is the average gain needed each day to achieve our final gain.

For the unleveraged index in our example:

If the index starts at 100, loses 10% on the first day (ending at 90), and then gains 11.1% on the second day (returning to 100), the arithmetic average of the daily returns is

https://preview.redd.it/k3xmg7b67ghd1.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5832a08f6346c7473a835275b9fe92ce15c2e18

However, the geometric average is calculated over the entire period to reflect the actual compounded return. In this case, the total return over two days is:

https://preview.redd.it/hf6fz9pa7ghd1.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bfb7a11f9b0bae0f32568b41ee94ef36a7302a6

For the leveraged ETF:

The daily arithmetic performance is calculated as follows:

Meanwhile, the true performance (geometric average) is:

The difference between these two averages is the volatility drag:

·         In the first case, the volatility drag is : 0.55%-0%=0.55%

·         In the second case, it is 1.11%-(-1.11%)=2.22%

 

We notice that for the LETF the volatility drag is more than twice the one without any leveraged. Indeed, the volatility drag is proportional to the square of the lever. Essentially, this is the risk with leveraged ETF: it amplifies volatility drag by the square of the lever.

We need to go a bit further into the concept of averages. Let xi denote the performance on day i and n be the investment period in days.

Do not worry about the formulas; they are easy. Here is the arithmetic average:

https://preview.redd.it/0zji8d8j7ghd1.png?width=194&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a7b80845adef3c8478ebf0e444fecc2cabafcec

And the geometric average:

https://preview.redd.it/wg6f73cn7ghd1.png?width=273&format=png&auto=webp&s=1796c397f320d717880f201dec023e41b6098ace

To summarize, the arithmetic average is average of daily performance values. The geometric average, however, is more relevant for our purposes because when raised to the power of the investment duration, it represents our overall gain.

A leveraged ETF multiplies the arithmetic mean by a factor L, thus each xi is now Lxi, and therefore we have:

https://preview.redd.it/w8re0sdr7ghd1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4cf0fbf16537f3f7f6cdeaa3f46fdc70b1dd69e

However, the LETF do not necessarily multiplies our gains.

https://preview.redd.it/09o5fi3u7ghd1.png?width=285&format=png&auto=webp&s=be1b2682b1685c473a63952a70c0c0792e57d579

The risk of leveraged ETFs is that they multiply the arithmetic mean by the leveraged factor but not the geometric mean, which represents the actual gain.

 

If we take the assumption that  xi follows a normal distribution with µ as the average (the arithmetic average of daily returns) and a standard deviation σ  (we will verify the normality assumption later), the relationship between the arithmetic Ma and the geometric mean Mg is:

https://preview.redd.it/d5s88lxi8ghd1.png?width=213&format=png&auto=webp&s=43930b7297f0ce1534aa1ab90b5efd0b0efae137

However, in order to get a leveraged factor of L, ETF issuers must take out a loan and pay interest on that loan, which results in a decrease in daily performance. These borrowing costs are also included in the index’s yield replicated by the LETF. In conclusion, the daily performance of a leveraged index is not Lµ , but Lµ-r with r being the daily interest cost of the loan.

In the case of the MSCI USA Leveraged 2 Index, according to MSCI documentation, the daily leveraged is not Lµ, but is instead:

https://preview.redd.it/7id5pj7s8ghd1.png?width=268&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca3c35060216d58b101fae7a232e5f0e3ca640c0

With:

𝑇: the number of calendar days between two successive trading dates.

𝑅: the overnight risk-free borrowing cost (€STR since 2021 and EONIA before). €STR and EONIA are European borrowing cost, since the index is replicated in Europe

Henceforth, I denote:

https://preview.redd.it/ki7ji8ow8ghd1.png?width=184&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f0ef78bf96d9bb741b8cc45fc022d1e6c528c5a

The €STR and EONIA rates are the interest paid by a bank which are borrowing euros for a one-day duration from another bank. EONIA was replaced by €STR since 2021 and both rates are closely linked to the European Central Bank (ECB) rates. The €STR is annualized, so it must be divided by 360 to know the interest paid for one day (mathematically, the 360th root should be taken, but bankers calculate by dividing by 360). Today, on April 29, 2024, the €STR rate is 3.90%.

For a lever factor L , µ becomes Lµ - r  and σ becomes L²σ², so we have:

https://preview.redd.it/hi0tpt449ghd1.png?width=297&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebbb9c6533f77622f0c4aa8be6508e9a4b403465

volatility drag is the second term in the formula in front of the minus sign

https://preview.redd.it/q4yljdq69ghd1.png?width=101&format=png&auto=webp&s=e86bec2ce94dd4fe17fda379ae0a3a680aee5c88

One can notice that volatility drag is proportional to the square of the leverage factor, as mentioned earlier in our example. This formula indicates a fundamental relationship: our gains will not be necessary boosted even if the daily average performance µ is good; the cost of borrowing should also be low.

However, the higher the volatility, the more the gains are eroded, in proportion to the square of the lever factor. Therefore, it is better to use lever on indexes with a high average daily performance, low volatility, and a low borrowing cost.

In reality, lever should be applied to ETFs that maximize the ratio µ- r / σ². This ratio provides something more than the Sharpe ratio µ-r /𝜎 (which measures the gain µ - r relatively to the risk σ  ) because it gives the best possible gain for a taken risk. This explains why leveraging individual stocks is a poor idea, even if µ - r  might be higher; the volatility σ of a single stock is too great. It is better to focus on indices.

Lastly, it is important to note that holding a portfolio consisting of half an unleveraged index and half an index with 2x leverage will not simulate a performance equivalent to a 1.5x leverage. This is because the volatility drag term is proportional to the square of the leverage, not the leverage itself. In the previous case, we have multiplied the volatility drag by 2²+1²/2=2.5  for the 50-50 portfolio, whereas for a portfolio entirely with 1.5x leverage, it is 1.5²=2.25. The only way to achieve a true 1.5x leverage is to rebalance the portfolio daily to maintain the 1.5 ratio. This rebalancing incurs significant costs (such as brokerage fees and the difference between the bid and ask prices).

It is also observed that the leverage that maximizes Mg seems to be L =µ - r / σ². Thus, we conclude that the higher the volatility σ of a reference index, the poorer the performance (geometric mean) is. Finally, contrary to what I have read, there is no beneficial volatility drag, as the value of volatility drag is necessarily negative.

# Normal Law hypothesis

Before looking at practical aspects of leveraged stock indices, we will check if our assumption of a normal distribution and the equality mentioned above are correct in practice. In the graph below, the borrowing cost r has been neglected and is set to 0. This approximation is justified because the goal of the graph is to validate the assumption of normality, not to estimate the gain of such an index. Ignoring the borrowing cost will not invalidate the following proof.

In the graph, the data for the S&P 500 price return (without reinvested dividends) has been considered, and a leverage of two (with borrowing cost r=0) has been applied. It's does not matter if the index taken is total or price return, indeed in this section the goal is to prove that normal distribution assumption is verify.

The averages shown in the graph are rolling averages over 10 years, meaning that the average for 1978 reflects the mean value between 1968 and 1978.

where,  µ and σ are estimated by taking the rolling average over 10 years preceding the date. In gray it is the actual annualized average gain over 10 years, and in orange is the estimation using the formula.

https://preview.redd.it/a6sca51caghd1.png?width=161&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a6e79176a306b858c6c6cf21129cff3ae1d7686

In other word the gray curve is the real annualized gain over 10 years (without borrowing cost) find thanks to S&P500 data. The orange curve use the formula above to find the annualized gain. One can notice that both curves are closed which means that formula given is trustable. If the formula is trustable the hypothesis behind it are also trustable, thus the normal distribution assumption is a good one.

Dont get me wrong the normal distribution hypothesis is trustable for this formula of volatility drag, however for other formulas or analysis this assumption may not be trustable.

It is observed that the gray and orange curves are overlapping, which allows us to verify the accuracy of our assumptions and the theory behind them. We conclude that the normality assumption in the quantification of volatility drag is correct for a market such as the S&P 500. For other markets, this normality assumption may not be accurate and should be verified.

The equation

https://preview.redd.it/dykvuj0haghd1.png?width=221&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fc0baa15c85e099bf85a51b50c4327901f0e0b6

is therefore an accurate estimation of reality (neglected the borrowing cost r does not invalidate the normality assumption). One might then think the solution is simple, we only have to set the lever factor to L= µ- r / σ² to maximize our gains. Yes, this is true, if the future values of 𝜇, 𝜎 and 𝑟 for the S&P 500 are known. However, here is the graph showing the average 𝜇 and 𝜎 of the S&P 500 without leverage over rolling 10-year periods.

https://preview.redd.it/p9xpckhmaghd1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=9466a525517b3c3f85c41366c3017c6a6a31e8a1

And here is the graph of the Federal Reserve interest rates, which r is closely related to, over the period from 1954 to 2024.

https://preview.redd.it/osri1gzoaghd1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f1f007b4f3451062fe5a3aaa970f71ffb55ab6c

One can notice that predicting 𝜇, 𝜎 and 𝑟 in advance is challenging, despite apparent cycles. Therefore, even if the theory provides a good estimate of the optimal leverage one should have if 𝜇 𝜎 and 𝑟 were known, it cannot predict in advance the best lever factor over time.

# Summary of the volatility drag

In summary, volatility drag is easy to estimate for a given period and is given by

https://preview.redd.it/l9uckxtuaghd1.png?width=98&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bdb53b3a953d7055fc0f764e04f394e8e14399a

volatility drag is also present when L=1. Therefore, volatility drag is not proof that a leveraged ETF (LETF) will necessarily lose value over time, as it is present in all stock indices. Finally, there is no beneficial volatility drag, contrary to what may be read, as the value is necessarily negative. The goal is to offset the negative volatility drag by increasing the average performance this average performance (Lµ-r) is reduced by the borrowing costs. We will explore their impact of borrowing cost on a LETF in the next section.

49,2024-08-14,49,"GOOG - Bull Case - Custom TPU leading to successful AI products I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.

Since late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.

It's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.

Previous generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.

With recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).

These observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.

The fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.

Cost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now."
12,2024-08-14,2,"UBS smashes second quarter profit expectations as Credit Suisse boosts revenue  Swiss banking giant UBS on Wednesday smashed net profit expectations for the second quarter, amid cost-cutting steps and swelling revenue at the lender’s global wealth management and investment bank units.

Net profit attributable to shareholders came in at $1.136 billion for the period, versus a company-compiled consensus forecast of $528 million.

Profit was nonetheless lower than the $1.755 reported in the first quarter, as expected by analysts.

UBS shares were 3% higher at 11:35 a.m. London time.

Group revenue also beat forecasts in the second quarter, coming in at $11.904 billion versus an LSEG-compiled poll of $11.522 billion.

UBS said strong capital markets activity had partially offset a drag from net interest income, which it had previously flagged would be weaker due to lower lending and deposit volumes and lower Swiss interest rates.

In the bank’s global wealth management unit, revenue increased by 15% to $6.053 billion, which UBS said was largely due to the consolidation of Credit Suisse. Revenue in the investment bank unit leapt 38% to $2.803 billion.

“Across the board we showed pretty good resilience, in investment banking, in wealth management, but also I think that we are making good progress in de-risking in our core and taking down cost there,” UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC’s Silvia Amaro in a Wednesday interview.

On the profit beat, Ermotti said: “It’s a combination of good momentum on the top-line, but also good progress on cost reductions.”

He added that the bank was seeing good momentum from client activity and transaction volumes in wealth management, though some headwinds on its margins from lower net interest income.

It has now been over a year since UBS formally took over Credit Suisse, triggering a huge integration process and creating a wealth management juggernaut. UBS said at the start of July the merger process had completed and that Credit Suisse — the Swiss bank which spectacularly collapsed in March 2023 after years of financial scandals — no longer existed as a separate entity.

Shedding risk-weighted assets — a major part of Credit Suisse’s business — has been a key part of that process.

UBS said it now expects to end 2024 with cumulative gross savings from the Credit Suisse deal of $7 billion, out of a target of $13 billion by 2026 compared with a 2022 baseline. It had previously aimed to deliver $6.5 billion in savings by the end of the year.

The bank had swung back to profit in the first quarter 2024 after two quarterly losses related to the cost of the integration.

“What’s next is a few years of work. We are still far away from the profitability UBS had before being asked to step in and rescue Credit Suisse,” Ermotti told CNBC, adding that the bank’s task now includes a focus on the U.S. and Asia-Pacific region.

In a note covering Wednesday’s results, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said: “UBS is delivering faster on the factors it can control – cost savings and [non-conforming loan] run down – which should provide some buffer against regulatory headwinds and a potentially more challenging operating environment.”

Too big to fail?

UBS shares rocketed 51.7% higher in 2023 as investors eyed the advantages from the acquisition of Credit Suisse, for which it paid a much lower price than the bank’s value in a deal facilitated by Swiss regulators.

Shares have since dipped 3.75% this year, in part rattled by new banking regulations proposed by authorities in Switzerland in an April report that would see UBS and three other “systemically relevant” banks face tougher capital requirements in order to protect the wider economy.

UBS has strongly criticized the proposals as unnecessary, arguing that the bank is not “too big to fail” — as alleged in the report — and would curb Switzerland’s global competitiveness.

Ermotti told CNBC on Wednesday UBS was “part of the solution” to banking instability in its rescue of Credit Suisse, rather than exacerbating the problem.

On resistance to banking consolidation in Europe, Ermotti said Wednesday that “the necessity for Europe to have larger financial players to have its own independence in financial matters is a given in my point of view.”

He added, “One has to probably recognize that post-Financial Crisis, Europe went too far in fragmenting or not allowing consolidation in the system which is now penalizing Europe and its financial system.”

In its outlook in the second quarter earnings, UBS said the macroeconomic picture was “clouded by ongoing conflicts, other geopolitial tensions and the upcoming US elections,” all leading to higher market volatility compared to the first half of the year.

However, asked about the recent spike in fears about a U.S. recession — as expected by the likes of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon — Ermotti said a “slowdown” in growth appeared more likely.

760,2024-08-14,267,"Mars to acquire Cheez-It, Pringles-maker Kellanova in $36 billion deal  Family-owned candy giant Mars, whose brands include M&M’s and Snickers, said on Wednesday it would buy Cheez-It and Pringles maker Kellanova in a nearly $36 billion deal, making it the biggest deal in the packaged food industry.

Mars will pay $83.50 per share in an all-cash deal for Kellanova, representing about a 33% premium to Kellanova’s close on Aug. 2, before Reuters first reported that Mars was exploring a deal for the Pringles maker.

Shares of the company rose 8% to $80.45 before the bell.

The deal for Kellanova comes as sales growth at U.S. packaged food companies including Kraft Heinz, Mondelez and Hershey have taken a hit as budget-strapped customers hunt for cheaper, private-label alternatives to pricier branded items.

This has spurred dealmaking in the packaged food sector as companies seek scale to weather the impact of price inflation and weight-loss drugs weighing on demand.

The deal dwarfs Mars’ $23 billion takeover of Wrigley in 2008 and would bring under one roof a slate of popular consumer brands including Mars’ Twix, Bounty and Milky Way chocolates as well as Kellanova’s snacks portfolio of Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats and Eggo frozen waffles.

The acquisition is not expected to go through too many antitrust roadblocks due to the limited overlap between the two companies’ offerings, legal experts had told Reuters.

Kellanova, which split from WK Kellogg Co. last October, is rooted in a salty snacks business in the U.S. and around the world, and selling cereal outside of North America. WK Kellogg was left with the North American cereal business of Kellogg, the original parent company.

158,2024-08-14,65,"Chinese tech giant Tencent's quarterly profit jumps 82% as key gaming unit accelerates  Tencent beat second-quarter top and bottom line estimates as growth in its key gaming division accelerated.

Here’s how Tencent did in the June quarter against LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: 161.12 billion Chinese yuan ($22.5 billion) versus 160.77 billion yuan expected.

Profit attributable to equity holders of the company: 47.63 billion Chinese yuan versus 39.95 billion yuan expected.

Revenue was up 8% year-on-year while profit rose 82%.

After suffering its first ever annual revenue decline in 2022, Tencent has been looking to reaccelerate growth in its core gaming business.

Investors have rewarded the company so far, with shares up around 27% this year. That’s in part thanks to the excitement around a new game called Dungeon & Fighter Mobile (DnF Mobile) which is produced by South Korean firm Nexon and distributed in China by Tencent.

DnF Mobile has been dominating the top grossing game charts in China, and investors are hoping Tencent could reap the benefits of its popularity for years to come, as it did with Honor of Kings.

Tencent said its China games business brought in revenue of 34.6 billion yuan in the second quarter, a 9% year-on-year rise. That was faster than the 3% growth seen in the first quarter of the year. Tencent attributed the performance to increased sales from Valorant and the “successful launch” of DnF Mobile.

“DnF Mobile, a newly released game, reactivated millions of IP (intellectual property) fans and is retaining players well, positioning it to become our next evergreen major hit,” Tencent said in its earnings release.

International games revenue also rose 9% versus the year ago period to 13.9 billion yuan.

Tencent’s online advertising business brought in 29.9 billion yuan in revenue in the second quarter, up 19% year-on-year. The tech giant attributed this to increased revnuee from video advertising on WeChat, China’s largest messaging app that Tencent owns.

Investors have long been excited about the ability for Tencent to monetize video on the WeChat app, which has more than 1.3 billion users.

Tencent’s fintech and business services division, which includes cloud computing and the WeChat Pay mobile payments feature saw revenue rise 4% year-on-year to 50.4 billion. The growth was dragged down by “further moderation in commercial payment revenue growth that reflected slow consumption spending,” Tencent said.

* **Risks:** This is definitely a speculative bet. If the trials fail, the stock could tank. But with a 50% estimated success rate, the risk/reward seems intriguing.

What are your thoughts? Is this worth the risk, or too much uncertainty? Curious to hear the community’s take on whether CMPS is a hidden gem or a potential trap."

174,2024-08-14,120,"The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now you’re probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  

1. Microsoft (MSFT)

Now you’re probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. 

Device revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing.” 

So now we go to our next company. 

2. Apple

Like Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you don’t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didn’t decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. 

Now you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor but Apple isn’t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things.” Ok let’s keep going. 

3. Nike

Nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you don’t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. They’re everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it’s expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels haven’t been seen since 2018.

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but Nike isn’t cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why it’s down.” Ok lets look at more. 

4. Home Depot and Lowe’s

The two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home you’re familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you’re paying attention to these two companies as they’re crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowe’s. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. 

Both Home Depot and Lowe’s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowe’s down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. 

Now you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about.” Ok how about another one. 

5. Target 

Target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. 

In 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. 

I can really keep going with this. Here is some more. 

1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline

2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline

3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline

4. Lululemon: massive stock decline

5. Dollar General: massive stock decline

6. Hershey: massive stock decline 

7. Starbucks: massive stock decline

Now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe you’re not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. 

We are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and it’s only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease it’s only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and they’re causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. 

This has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? 

I personally don’t think so. However I think going forward we won’t see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts. Let me know what you think about this theory."

Despite notable successes that Disney had recently (like **Inside Out 2** and **Deadpool & Wolverine** making bank), the stock is still not in the best shape:

https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dis

And while Peltz/Perlmutter sold their stocks after what happened in April, Perlmutter did say this:

> In a parting dig, he told the publication it’s because he doesn’t have confidence in management, and that he might be a buyer again if it falls to $65-$75.
> 
> Disney stock is trading down about 3% today at $91. It’s been as high as $124 and as low as $79 over the past year.

Based on these, do you think:

1. Disney is at death's door like YouTube channels like Valliant Renegade is claiming and Peltz/Perlmutter are only ones who can save it, and therefore, Iger must be ousted immediately and have those two take control of Disney? Why or why not?

2. They will try to oust Iger later this year? Why or why not?

Also, if only they can save Disney, how do you think they're going to save it?

Disclaimer: I don't watch Valliant Renegade videos. I used that channel as an example because at least some people here seem to think that it's credible."
3303,2024-08-13,602,"Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.

Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results.

**Breakup**

Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.

Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.

Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.”

Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.

Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial.

If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.

**Data Access**

Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.

Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.

Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.

In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.

**AI Products**

For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.

Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.

Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.

114,2024-08-13,43,"Google launches first AI-powered Android update and new Pixel 9 phones Google on Tuesday announced new artificial intelligence features that are coming to Android devices. The move to bring its Gemini AI assistant to supported devices shows again how Google aims to put its AI in front of consumers before Apple, which will launch its AI on iPhones, Macs and iPads later this year.

Google doesn’t make a lot of money from its hardware business but the latest Android features could help drive new revenue through the company’s Gemini AI subscription program.

“We’ve completely rebuilt the assistant experience with Gemini, so you can speak to it naturally the way you would with another person,” said Android Ecosystem President Sameer Samat in a Tuesday blog post. “It can understand your intent, follow your train of thought and complete complex tasks.”

“Starting today, you can bring up Gemini’s overlay on top of the app you’re using to ask questions about what’s on your screen,” Samat wrote. It will be available on hundreds of phone models from dozens of device makers, according to Google.

Google previously had some AI features in Android, but this is the first year it’s heavily emphasizing new capabilities powered by a large AI language model installed on devices.

One example the company provided involved a user uploading a photo of a concert list and asking Gemini to see if their calendar is free, after which Gemini checks Google Calendar. If the user has availability in their schedule, Gemini offers to create a reminder to check ticket prices later that night.

The assistant can also perform tasks using information from Google apps.

“For example, Gemini can help create a daily workout routine based on your personal trainer’s email, or use your resume in Google Drive to write a work bio,” the company stated in its blog post. 

The company also said a user might ask the Gemini assistant to draft an email and “create an image of a cake for someone who loves space,” which the assistant can create and attach to the email. Or, in YouTube, a user might ask Gemini a question about the content in a video.

You can ask about what’s on your phone screen in other apps, too, like Maps, Flights and Gmail. Google said it’s working to add support for third-party extensions, which suggests developers may be able to add the option to their apps later.

Gemini’s assistant has a range of voices. A user can have a human-like conversation through its Gemini “Live” feature, which the company first announced at its May developer conference. “Live” will initially be available for select devices and subscribers to Google’s Gemini Advanced program, which costs $19.99 per month.

In June, Apple announced its long-awaited artificial intelligence push, Apple Intelligence, that can do tasks like recognize notifications important to personal context, and do cross-application tasking as well as letting Siri tap into OpenAI’s ChatGPT when needed for tasks such as its writing tools and creating images.

Apple’s system is currently in testing. Some early features will launch this fall alongside new iPhones, but the bulk of the system won’t be released until next year.

New Pixel 9 phones and Pixel Watch 3

Google also announced its latest line of homegrown “Pixel” phones, including the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which come with the Gemini AI features.

The Pixel 9 series has, among other new features, an upgraded camera and a screen that’s 35% brighter for better viewing in direct sunlight. It ships with Google’s latest Tensor G4 processor and 16GB of RAM to support AI use. RAM stands for random access memory —an important part of a computer’s hardware that stores data needed to run applications.

RAM is a crucial component for running artificial intelligence inside a smartphone. Google has said that the amount of memory is a major factor in determining whether a phone can run AI.

By contrast, only high-end iPhones released in 2023 can run Apple Intelligence, which AI developers believe is due to lower amounts of memory installed on older iPhones.

The Pixel 9 starts at $799, which costs $100 more than the Pixel 8, however, smartphone costs have risen across most phone makers in the last year. The Pixel 9 Pro, which comes with a free year of “Gemini Advanced” subscription, starts at $999 and the Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at $1,099. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at $1,799.

Lastly, Google also announced the Pixel Watch 3. It’s available in two sizes, 41 millimeter and 45 mm, with larger screens than earlier models. New features include the option to plan running workouts, information on your recovery with readiness and cardio load data, and AI-powered workout recommendations. Google also said the Pixel Watch 3 is more deeply embedded with its ecosystem, allowing you to access Nest camera and doorbell feeds, the Google TV remote, offline Google Maps, and more. The Pixel Watch 3 offers up to 24 hours of battery life, or up to 36 hours with Battery Saver mode.

692,2024-08-13,201,"Starbucks replaces CEO Laxman Narasimhan with Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol  Starbucks announced Tuesday it’s replacing CEO Laxman Narasimhan with Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol.

Shares of Starbucks rose 10% in premarket trading on the news, while Chipotle’s stock fell 10%.

Narasimhan took over as chief executive in March 2023. The coffee giant’s performance has struggled this year, hurt by weak sales in the U.S. and China, its two largest markets. Former CEO Howard Schultz, who handpicked Narasimhan as his successor, had written an open letter in May, weighing in on the company’s issues and offering advice but never addressing Narasimhan by name. Activist investor Elliott Management had acquired a stake in the company in recent weeks.

Starbucks’ shares have fallen 21% during Narasimhan’s tenure, excluding Tuesday’s move.

Narasimhan’s departure is effective immediately. Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri will step in as interim chief executive until Sept. 9, when Niccol officially takes over the top job.

Niccol has served as Chipotle’s CEO since 2018. Prior to that, he led Yum Brands’ Taco Bell. As CEO of Chipotle, he helped the chain rebound from its foodborne illness scandal and led its restaurants through the pandemic. In recent quarters, while other restaurants have reported a sharp pullback in consumer spending, Chipotle has seen its traffic and sales climb, bucking the trend.

Chipotle’s COO Scott Boatwright will serve as interim CEO of the burrito chain. Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung, who was planning on retiring next year, will now stay on as president of strategy, finance and supply chain.

0,2024-08-13,25,"Excess returns are competed away - Is ASTS immune Hey everyone,   
I'm an investor in ASTS and over the last few months there's been one question that I have struggled to answer.  
Normally I would ask the other investors in the ASTS subreddit but I'm worried about their bias, I myself am biased.

In the all-in-podcast the concept of excess returns being competed away has come up multiple times and it makes complete sense. If someone is making more money than they should somewhere, someone is bound to compete against them and take those returns down to where it makes sense.

The issue I've run into with this concept being used on ASTS is spectrum.  
On one hand we've got starlink D2D and Lynk as competitors but the piece of the puzzle that we have and that they're mostly missing is the customers.  
Customers as in mobile network operators who own spectrum.  
If an MNO picks ASTS, they cant exactly pick starlink D2D as well, the satellite systems would cause interference if they tried to service the same area on earth.   
They could split the spectrum they offer to each but in doing so, they may still cause interference and reduce the performance of those services in their territories.

So MNOs will pick one D2D (Direct 2 Device) provider to provide coverage where there are coverage gaps.

Now to really ask the question. How would excess returns be competed away? MNOs will go with whoever provides the best coverage at the best price, there are less than 1700 MNO/MVNO (potential customers). 

I've tried to game theory this as well.  
If you're an MNO then you would take the option that makes you the most money, if that's ASTS who provides the most capacity, has a revenue share model then you pick them. What about your competitor, wouldn't they do the same? How about neighboring country MNOs, wouldn't the same idea run through their minds?

138,2024-08-13,37,"Home Depot expects sales to weaken as consumers grow more cautious  Home Depot on Tuesday topped quarterly expectations, but cautioned that sales will be weaker than expected in the back half of the year as high interest rates and consumer uncertainty dampen demand.

The home improvement retailer said it now expects full-year comparable sales to decline by 3% to 4% compared to the prior fiscal year. It had previously expected comparable sales, a metric that takes out the impact of store openings and closures and other one-time factors, to decline about 1%.

Home Depot’s total annual sales will get a boost from its recently completed acquisition of SRS Distribution, a company that sells supplies to professionals in the landscaping, roofing or pool businesses. Total sales are expected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% including a 53rd week in the fiscal year and approximately $6.4 billion in sales from SRS. Yet excluding sales from SRS, its new full-year forecast would have amounted to a revenue cut.

In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said Home Depot has contended with consumers who have a “deferral mindset” since the middle of 2023. Interest rates have caused them to put off buying and selling homes and borrowing money for bigger projects, such as a kitchen renovation. 

Yet over the past quarter, he said surveys of customers and home professionals like contractors have captured another challenge: a more cautious consumer.

“Pros tell us that, for the first time, their customers aren’t just deferring because of higher financing costs,” he said. “They’re deferring because of a sense of greater uncertainty in the economy.”

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street expected for the three month period that ended July 28, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $4.60 vs. $4.49 per share expected

Revenue: $43.18 billion vs. $43.06 billion expected

Shares fell more than 4% in premarket trading.

Home Depot kicks off a wave of retail earnings, as economists, investors and politicians pay close attention to the health of the American consumer and try to forecast the economic outlook, including the odds of a recession. Though inflation has cooled, higher prices – particularly for everyday costs like groceries, energy and housing – continue to frustrate customers. They’ve also become a major talking point on the 2024 campaign trail.

Consumer clues will keep coming this week and next, as Walmart reports earnings and the government shares retail sales numbers on Thursday. Other retailers, including Target, Macy’s and Best Buy, will also post results in the coming weeks.

Compared with many other retailers, Home Depot has a more financially stable customer base. About half of its sales come from home professionals and about half come from do-it-yourself customers. About 90% of those DIY customers own their own homes.

Yet Home Depot still felt the impact of consumer uncertainty, McPhail said. He said the company saw slower demand for a wide range of project-driven items, including lighting and flooring.

Home Depot’s net income for the fiscal second quarter decreased to $4.56 billion, or $4.60 per share, from $4.66 billion, or $4.65 per share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue rose slightly from $42.92 billion in the year-ago period.

Comparable sales dropped 3.3% in the quarter across the business and declined 3.6% in the U.S. That was worse than the 2.1% decrease that analysts expected, according to StreetAccount.

It marked the seventh consecutive quarter of negative comparable sales at Home Depot.

Consumers have postponed projects in part because of a widely anticipated rate cut by the Federal Reserve, McPhail said. In late July, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said policymakers could cut rates at the central bank’s September meeting if the data supports it.

That would lead to lower mortgage rates and borrowing costs for homeowners who want to tack on an addition or finance a project, such as a bathroom remodel.

“What our customers tell their pros is, ‘Everything I read tells me interest rates will be lower in three to six months,’” McPhail said. ”‘Why would I borrow to finance the project now rather than just wait a few months?’”

Yet Home Depot leaders have emphasized home improvement’s bright long-term outlook, referring to the country’s aging homes, its shortage of houses and significant property value gains, especially during the years of the Covid pandemic. 

And McPhail said most of Home Depot’s customers remain financially healthy and employed, even if they’re spending less on home improvement right now.

Shares of Home Depot closed at $345.81 on Monday. As of Monday’s close, the company’s shares are down less than 1% so far this year, trailing behind the S&P 500′s 12% gains.

11,2024-08-12,41,"Stagflation Risk Are Gone? Does the Fed care about inflation anymore?

Ever since the higher initial jobless claim and weaker job report, market's assumed we're basically very close to a recession. Claudia Sahm doesn't believe the Sahm rule is correct this time, but theoretically whenever it triggers, the US is already a few months into a recession.

So now obviously Powell is gonna be solely focused on the employment side. He seemed to lean towards that side already in July. Fed Hawks like Bowman, Barkin, Waller, Schmid, Logan, Musalem can probably be convinced to cut 25 bps in Sept, because the doves agreed to not cut in July.

The Fed had typically wanted core PCE MoM prints to come in between 0.20 to 0.25% to get a rate cut in Sept. We'll get PPI and CPI in 2 days, which would allow economists to calculate the core PCE. Do we even care what the inflation prints come in at this point, as long as it doesn't go above 0.30% MoM? Market's already pricing in a guaranteed cut in Sept, Nov, Dec. Is a hot inflation print gonna change that? Is the market gonna go back to pricing in recession risk if the inflation print comes in hot, because the Fed might not be able to cut as many as they would like?"

if you look at no growth/slow growth companies, their pe ratio has expanded (after 2008 and infinite QE) from 10-15 to 20, 30, 30 or even up to 80

question is, can such enormous pe ratio be justifiable even with no unlimited QE/free money when their growth are  literally non existent when interest rate is no longer 0% but at 2\~5%?

Contrary to most people's belief, imo, lots of tech stock, high growth companies are actually the cheapest (yes. cheapest) stock right now  if you consider company's earning and growth in to the equation

I know what wash sale rule generally states, but it's not clear if it only applies in a sell event basis or individual share basis. For example, if, over the course of a month, I accumulated 100 shares of stock A at different price points, bought 1 share at a time, with individual share price ranging from $10-$100. Let's say my total cost for the whole 100 shares is $7000, averaging to $70 per share. When the stock rises to $80, I decide to sell all 100 shares all at once, for a gain of $1000. Obviously, for some shares that were bought above $80 before, they were a loss, but for other shares bought below $80 it's a gain, and the single sell event itself is a gain. If within 30 days (for ease, let's say it's within 30 days of all these shares), I decide to buy the stock again, does wash sale apply to some of the shares that were bought above $80? Or does IRS only regard this one sell event as a gain? Thanks in advance"

Europe’s Auto Chipmakers Have a Deepening China Habit

Latest earnings show China’s EV growth as a rare bright spot
Beijing’s push for tech independence threatens foreign sales

As advanced semiconductor companies in the US and allied countries pull back from China, a less glamorous sector of the chip market is turning even more to the world’s second-biggest economy.

This season’s earnings show just how important China is to the largest players in automotive chipmaking at a moment when sales are suffering due to inventory gluts and slowing adoption in the West for electric vehicles, a key driver of demand.

In the past two weeks, Kurt Sievers, chief executive officer of NXP Semiconductors NV, contrasted weakness in industrial markets in Europe and the Americas with the “staggering growth” of EV sales in China this year. Infineon Technologies AG CEO Jochen Hanebeck said that China’s resilience helped the German chipmaker’s bottom line even as a broader recovery from the EV slump remains elusive. For Texas Instruments Inc., China business is up as much as 20% across all five of its product markets.

Deepening engagement with China could become a double-edged sword for these chipmakers as geopolitical tensions expand into the automotive arena. The European Union and the US have imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports and Beijing is threatening a response. Now, even supplies of mature, so-called legacy chips are under scrutiny in Washington and Brussels.

US-China tensions over technology have to date focused on Washington’s efforts to curb Beijing’s access to leading-edge semiconductors and the equipment used to make them. That’s prompted a Chinese push to build out its technological self-sufficiency, notably in automotive chips. Since these don’t depend on the latest manufacturing processes and are largely unaffected by US export controls, there’s little to stop China from ramping up their development, and displacing foreign chipmakers down the line.

“Just as a strong automotive industry in the EU has supported European leaders in automotive chips such as Infineon, NXP and STMicroelectronics, the world-leading expansion of China’s EV industry is boosting development of Chinese vendors of such chips,” researchers John Lee and Jan-Peter Kleinhans wrote in a recent report for the German Council on Foreign Relations. That helps Chinese carmakers become more competitive, “with potentially major impacts for European firms and national economies,” they said. Automotive chips, a market McKinsey forecasts will be worth $150 billion by 2030, is one area of the semiconductor industry where Europe punches above its weight. Its expansion is due to increasingly sophisticated technology that’s turning cars, and especially EVs, into computers on wheels, with climate control, infotainment, self-driving functions and safety features now completely dependent on the tiny electronic components.

China is both the largest producer and the world’s biggest market for EVs: Shenzhen-based BYD Co. reported deliveries of a record 340,800 passenger vehicles in July, up 31% from the same month last year. Yet Chinese manufacturers mostly rely on foreign companies for the multiple chips that modern high-end cars require, including sensors, power chips for regulating the flow of electricity, and microcontroller units, or MCUs, which are effectively small computers used for functions like braking.

China’s automotive chipmakers can only meet about 10% of domestic demand at present, according to Lee and Kleinhans. That’s a boon for Infineon, NXP and French-Italian concern STMicroelectronics NV, which each earn about a third of their revenue from China. For Renesas Electronics Corp. of Japan and Texas Instruments, two of the other main players, it’s about 25% and 20%, respectively.

The Chinese government has asked EV firms such as BYD and Nio to increase their purchases from local auto chipmakers, and most new chip fabrication plants being built in China are for automotive. As a result, the European Commission is raising concerns that its chipmakers are at risk of losing substantial market share in China, Bloomberg News reported in June.

While quarterly results are not usually broken down by region, presentations made to investors this season offer some insight into just how critical China is to European chipmakers, especially in the current challenging times: Shares in Tokyo-based Renesas fell the most in more than 15 years on July 25 after its operating profit underwhelmed.

Infineon’s Hanebeck, reporting disappointing third-quarter sales on Aug. 5, cited “tepid” demand in Western markets while singling out China as a bright spot witnessing “healthy consumer demand, which helps us particularly given our No. 1 automotive market position there.” STMicro, while lowering its revenue forecast, sending its stock down the most in four years, stressed the potential upside of a long-term agreement announced in June with China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. to supply it with silicon carbide power devices for EVs, along with a joint lab “to share knowledge and explore innovative solutions.”

That follows a joint venture it announced last year with Sanan Optoelectronics for silicon carbide device manufacturing in China. Germany’s Robert Bosch GmbH, another autochip player, meanwhile signed a $1 billion, 10-year contract for the development of silicon-carbide power modules in Suzhou, China. Also last year, Volkswagen AG announced a joint venture with China-based autonomous driving chip developer Horizon Robotics.

“European auto chipmakers appear to be following in the footsteps of German automakers in choosing to deepen partnerships with Chinese entities as an insurance policy in the China market,” Rhodium Group researchers led by Reva Goujon said in a May report.

The question is whether either the EU or the US is ready to act against China’s capacity to produce its own autochips. In April, the EU-US Trade and Technology Council expressed concerns aimed at China about “non-market economic policies and practices” that may lead to excessive dependencies for legacy chips, saying they may develop “joint or cooperative measures” to address distortionary effects. For Goujon, though, European joint ventures with China — what she calls “entanglements” — make it less likely that countries like Germany “would endorse economic security measures that entail unwinding transactions in China — unless they were already losing significant market share, revenue, and jobs in the Chinese market with little left to lose.”

Chipmakers are of course aware of the dangers, but at least in public they have adopted varying degrees of concern. “We all know that Chinese local competition is coming,” starting with “low-end” MCUs, NXP’s Sievers said July 23. His answer is to push his company’s development into higher performance processors.

China’s attempts to localize its chip supply will “be a slow process given foreign chipmakers still offer quality and reliability,” which are particularly important assets in the automotive market, said Ken Hui, a senior technology analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Given that China is adding more chip manufacturing capacity than the rest of the world combined, it may be only a matter of time before it catches up.

Texas Instruments CEO Haviv Ilan certainly sounds far from sanguine about China. While he said July 24 that “we can compete and we can win business,” he acknowledged that competition was growing stronger. “I think it’s a mistake for us to think that these guys are only doing, you know, simple parts,” he said. “These are very ambitious, highly educated competitors.”"
0,2024-08-11,19,"AppLovin is an interesting company, but I'm somewhat on the fence. AppLovin operates a mobile gaming company with hundreds of millions of daily active players and a software company, which was started in 2012. The company works as follows: The software division offers a marketplace, among other less important services, where companies can advertise on their apps, and other companies can place ads for their apps. These desired ads are then sorted by an in-house AI called ""Axon,"" which ensures the ads reach the appropriate viewers.

What makes this AI special is that it is fed with data from 700 million mobile gamers, which, according to the company, makes it very effective.

The software division is currently growing by about 50% annually, and in the last quarter, revenue grew by 37%.

Naturally, AppLovin has very good margins, with a gross margin of 70% and a net income margin of 20%. I also foresee growth in the net income margin through cost-cutting.

In the mobile app ad business, AppLovin is well-regarded despite large competitors like Google, and it is used by many developers, overshadowing other providers like Unity.

The CEO is also the founder and holds a significant number of shares. It's also positive for shareholders that the company is buying back shares—2.5% last year and 6.6% TTM.

However, as I mentioned, there are also negative points:

I have studied the company for a long time and found some things that I don't find ideal for an investment. Regarding ad publishers, I've seen studies showing that companies make more money when they advertise through Google's program (AdMob) than with AppLovin. I've also seen many reviews where people described how their AppLovin account, which they used to run ads on their apps, was suddenly banned without any notice or warning.

In itself, I don't believe these individual issues will impact revenue, but I fear this might just be the tip of the iceberg.

I also fear headwinds from privacy changes by Apple or even competition from Google.

For me personally, I think I’ll buy a small position at first because this way, I have less risk. However, with AppLovin's potential growth rate, the position could still develop into a significant part of my portfolio.

What do you think about this?"

Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app often used by the former president, also reported lower revenue for the quarter that ended June 30, compared to the same period last year.

The stock price of Trump Media, which trades under the DJT ticker, has fallen sharply from a high of more than $71 per share shortly after began publicly trading in late March following a merger with a so-called special acquisition corporation, to close at $26.21 per share Friday afternoon.

304,2024-08-09,125,"Stellantis laying off 2,450 workers, discontinuing Ram 'Classic' truck Automaker Stellantis plans to indefinitely lay off up to 2,450 U.S. factory workers later this year as it discontinues production of an older version of its Ram 1500 pickup truck in Michigan.

The truck, which is produced alongside the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, has been largely used as a low-cost pickup to sell to entry-level buyers and fleet customers since the automaker introduced a new generation of the Ram 1500 in 2018.

The current Ram 1500, which was recently updated for the 2025 model year, is produced at a nearby plant. Operations at that facility will continue as planned.

“With the introduction of the new Ram 1500, production of the Ram 1500 Classic at the Warren [Michigan] Truck Assembly Plant will come to an end later this year,” the company said in an emailed statement.

The discontinuation of the Ram 1500 “Classic” vehicle is not unexpected, but the company has not announced a vehicle to replace the truck. That’s concerning for local governments, workers and the United Auto Workers union, which represents the plant.

The layoffs are expected to occur as soon as October. They are the latest for Stellantis, which has cut production at several plants amid sales issues.

36,2024-08-09,7,"Analyzing the Relationship Between Wikipedia Page Views and Stock Prices for TMO **Title:** Analyzing Wikipedia Page Views and Stock Prices for Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) – Seeking Feedback

---

**Body:**

I recently came across a discussion on Reddit about using trends in Wikipedia page views to predict stock earnings reports. Intrigued by the idea, I decided to test this hypothesis on a stock I'm interested in: Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO). My initial thought was to plot Wikipedia page view data against stock prices, particularly around earnings reports, to see if there were any discernible trends or correlations.

Below is a summary of my findings, along with the analysis I conducted. I’d love to get some feedback from the community on whether I’m on the right track or if there are other angles I should explore.

### Key Visualizations:

- **[TMO Stock Price and Wikipedia Page Traffic](https://imgur.com/a/8svJ8ET)**
  - This plot shows the relationship between TMO's stock price and Wikipedia page views over the last five years.
  - The blue line represents TMO's adjusted stock price, while the green line represents Wikipedia page views.
  - Earnings announcements are marked with red dots.

### Key Points of the Analysis:

**Data Collection:**
- I pulled TMO stock price data from Yahoo Finance for the past five years.
- I gathered Wikipedia page traffic data for the ""Thermo Fisher Scientific"" page using the `pageviews` package.
- I also fetched earnings dates for TMO using the Alpha Vantage API.

**Initial Observations:**
- Surprisingly, my initial hypothesis didn’t hold. There seemed to be no clear relationship between spikes in Wikipedia page views and changes in TMO's stock price, even around earnings announcements.

### Event Study:

- **[Event Study: Impact of Earnings Announcements](https://imgur.com/a/myXJlF8)**
  - I performed an event study to examine stock returns and Wikipedia page views around earnings dates. The analysis showed no strong patterns linking earnings announcements to significant changes in either stock prices or Wikipedia page views.

I also analyzed the volatility of TMO stock around earnings dates. The results suggested that while Wikipedia page views fluctuated, they did not correlate with increased stock volatility.

272,2024-08-09,52,"TSMC sales grow 45% in July on strong AI chip demand (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue rose 45% in July, accelerating its pace of growth from the June quarter and bolstering hopes for sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp.

Sales for the month reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts project TSMC revenue should grow 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July result suggesting TSMC may surpass those expectations.

Taiwan’s biggest company is one of the key bellwethers for AI demand, as the go-to chipmaker for leading accelerator makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the sole supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, at a time the mobile device market is showing signs of bouncing off post-Covid era lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook to beyond the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously.

TSMC offered an upbeat assessment of its business and prospects when it last reported earnings, with Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei signaling the company may have room to raise prices as more of its customers transition to its most advanced technology and have to compete for limited capacity. High-performance computing, led by AI, contributed 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, the first time it has accounted for more than half.

Still, investors have started to question whether the billions of dollars Big Tech firms have invested in the infrastructure to support the AI boom will result in substantial returns, while a potential delay in Nvidia’s development of a new generation of AI chips is spurring concerns over the progress of the emerging technology.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, marking its second-highest sales gain in the past 20 months, aligned with our expectations for robust 3Q performance. This surge could indicate sustained, strong AI chip demand and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC is well positioned to beat the top end of its $23.2 billion 3Q sales guidance.

Worries about the global economic outlook over the past week interrupted the AI rally that had seen key players like TSMC gains billions in market value. Investors opted to cash out of some of the year’s biggest gainers, pushing TSMC’s shares down 10% in a day, though the company recovered much of that in subsequent days as money managers saw a good buying opportunity.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

13,2024-08-09,16,"Deep dive into UpWork ($UPWK) - An assymetric opportunity **1.0 Introduction**

The freelance gig economy is growing rapidly, and UpWork is well-positioned as a **leading platform** in this space. In this post, I will break down why I think this company is an underappreciated gem and why it is poised for long-term success.



I believe three tailwinds must be addressed before we dive into the company’s financials:

**1.1** **Millennial and Gen Z Workforce Preferences**

Younger generations place a high value on work-life balance, flexibility, and autonomy. They prefer to be their bosses, manage their schedules, and choose projects that interest them. Given their tech savviness, the “freelance population” will only increase over time. 

Based on a survey, 31% of the participants between the ages of 18 to 29 have freelanced. This is a much higher percentage compared to the other age groups:

30 to 49 years: 18%

50 to 64 years: 13%

The **workforce in 10 years** will be significantly different than the workforce today. The number of freelancers in the U.S. alone is expected to grow at a rate of 4% per year.

  
**1.2** **Change in the educational** **landscape**

The barrier to becoming a freelancer is low. There are numerous educational institutions and online sources (YouTube, Udacity, Coursera, edX, Pluralsight, etc.), to obtain the digital skills needed. Whether that is graphic design, data analysis, digital marketing, video editing, project management, web development, AI… The list goes on.



**1.3** **Companies can save resources, and be quicker to market**

The traditional recruitment process may take weeks while hiring a freelancer can be done in hours. The counter-argument is - *Well, how can companies be sure that they’ve hired the right person?* Although there are no guarantees, unlike traditional recruitment, every freelancer has public reviews provided by previous clients. In addition, if the right person was not hired for a particular task, “*unhiring****”*** can be done much quicker and without additional costs.

The demand for freelancers by large companies is only going to increase over time. Instead of hiring a full-time employee for a project that takes 70% of the time for a few months, hiring a freelancer will prove to be the best solution. The need will be fulfilled, it will bring cost efficiency and flexibility, and it comes with access to a global talent pool. The number of clients using UpWork as of Q2-2024 stands at **868,000**, and it grows at a rate of 4% per year, comparable with the growth of the number of freelancers (in the U.S.).

In addition, companies can build **a continuous 24/7 work cycle**, by hiring freelancers that operate in different time zones. Projects can progress around the clock, **reducing the time to market.**



**2.0 Competition**

One of the topics that is often asked - *What about its competition?*

Well, let’s take a step back and ask the right question - **Who is UpWork competing with?**

1. **Fiverr** - Although it is perceived as the main competitor, only 5% of the projects on UpWork are <$300, meaning there’s not as much overlap between the two companies as it is commonly thought. UpWork is differentiating as the go-to platform for larger projects and/or long-term job positions.
2. **Recruitment/Staffing agencies** - From Robert Half and Randstad to Pagegroup, these companies are the giants in the recruitment industry. However, the stock prices of the last decade reflect the disappointing revenue growth, which has been below the inflation rate. The ultimate outcome is that **their margins are getting destroyed** which is a clear sign of **the disruption happening at scale**, and I believe this is only the start.
3. **Other online job boards** - Although many platforms specialize in certain industries or job types, their overall size and reach are often limited. This gives UpWork a network advantage due to its larger and more diverse user base.

To summarize: UpWork’s real competition isn’t Fiverr or traditional recruitment agencies; it’s the inertia of the old way of doing business, which is rapidly changing.

  
**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Let's take a look at the fun stuff. UpWork’s financials tell a compelling story of revenue growth and margin expansion. ***What more can one ask for?***

The revenue growth doesn’t come as a surprise, given the ever-growing gig economy. 

*But what about the margins?*

As every company that relies on software, it is not capital-intensive and can scale up without significant investments. The company doesn’t need twice the assets, nor twice the employees, to support twice as much activity on its platform.

As the company grows, the economies of scale kick in, leading to margin expansion.

***Between 2019 and today:***

The revenue grew from \~$300m to \~$740m and the following was introduced:

* Contract initiation fee
* Freelance Plus subscription
* Connects economy (which allows the freelancers to apply to a project)

This led to gross margin expansion **from 71% to 76%.**

In addition, *Sales & Marketing*, and *General & Administrative* continue to decrease as % of revenue.

This leads to improvement of the operating margin **from -6% to +7%.**

In the first half of 2024, UpWork generated **$41m in net profits ($82m annualized)**. The excess cash has been used for share buybacks, and the # of shares outstanding was reduced by **almost 4%**, which is impressive for such a short timeframe.

  
**4.0 Valuation**

Despite all the positives within the company and the earnings report being in line with expectations, the share price was down \~10%.

The market cap of the company is $1.25 billion. Using the annualized profitability of H1-2024, the company trades at a P/E of \~15. This is incredibly low, given the company is still growing (it grew 15% in Q2-2024 vs. Q2-2023) and its margin will expand even more.

The low share price should be welcomed by long-term investors, as it allows the management to buy back even more shares at a lower price.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is close to **$1,8 billion ($13,6/share)**. The two key assumptions relate to the revenue growth and the operating margin. Here’s my rationale:

1. **Revenue** - As indicated above, \~4% growth should arise only from the growth in the # of freelancers. As UpWork is dominating the field, I do expect it to attract many existing freelancers as well. In addition, there is the impact of inflation (\~3%/year). All of this combined should lead to at least 8% revenue growth, per year.
2. **Operating margin -** Both the CEO (Hayden Brown) and the CFO (Erica Gessert) emphasized their focus on margin expansion. Their guidance is 35% adjusted EBITDA, which translates to an operating margin of \~20%. I am more conservative in my assumptions and use 15% as the target margin instead.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you h**ave different assumptions than mine regarding the rev**enue growth over the next decade & the operating margin:

|Revenue / Operating margin|10%|15%|20%|Revenue CAGR |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|60% ($1,2b)|$7,9|$11,9|$15,4|4,8%|
|88% ($1,4b)|$8,9|$13,6|$17,1|6,5%|
|115% ($1,6b)|$9,8|$15,0|$19,7|8,0%|



As I’m writing this, the share price is $9,4, which implies the market expects:

1. Either the operating margin doesn’t increase above \~10%, and/or
2. The average revenue growth over the next decade is below 4%.

***Given the analysis above, I find this unlikely.***

If the management delivers the guided margin expansion, the fair value today is roughly **2x today’s share price.**

As the freelance economy continues to expand, I believe UpWork will increasingly be recognized for its true value.

36,2024-08-08,7,"E.l.f. Beauty sales jump 50% on gains in color cosmetics, launch of Bronzing Drops  E.l.f. Beauty’s growth story is still going.

The cosmetics retailer on Thursday blew past quarterly estimates again, posting a 50% gain in sales. 

The company’s sales soared to $324.5 million in its fiscal first quarter, leading it to raise its full-year guidance. That increase follows a staggering 76% jump in the year-ago quarter.

CEO Tarang Amin told CNBC the company saw growth across its categories. He added that its Bronzing Drops serum quickly became a best seller on the company’s website after its launch during the quarter.

Here’s how the cosmetics company performed compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.10 adjusted vs. 84 cents expected

Revenue: $324 million vs. $305 million expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 was $47.6 million, or 81 cents per share, compared with $53 million, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier.  

Sales rose to $324.5 million, up about 50% from $216.3 million a year earlier. 

Following quarter after quarter of outsized growth, Wall Street has come to expect a lot from E.l.f. Beauty. Though it raised its guidance Thursday, the outlook still fell flat after such a big first-quarter beat. 

For fiscal 2025, E.l.f. now expects sales of between $1.28 billion and $1.3 billion, compared with its previous outlook of $1.23 billion and $1.25 billion. Analysts had expected sales guidance of $1.3 billion, according to LSEG.

The company now anticipates its adjusted net income will be between $198 million and $201 million, compared with a previous outlook of between $187 million and $191 million. E.l.f. expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.36 and $3.41, compared with previous guidance of $3.20 to $3.25. Analysts had expected earnings of $3.42 per share, according to LSEG. 

Shares fell about 6% in extended trading.

When it reported fiscal 2024 results in May, E.l.f. disappointed investors with an outlook that came in below expectations. Sentiment later turned around after its finance chief, Mandy Fields, suggested that the company tends to issue conservative guidance. 

“Last year, we started our guidance at 22% to 24% range, ended the year at 77%,” Fields told analysts at the time. “I’m not saying that we’re promising 77% this year for sure. But what I will say is that gives you a little bit of insight into our guidance philosophy.” 

On Thursday, Amin told CNBC that Fields takes a “balanced” approach to guidance and prefers to take things one quarter at a time. 

“If you look at our history over the last five years, these 22 quarters, we typically guide lower than where we eventually come out,” said Amin. “We never want to get ahead of ourselves, and overall the strategy has worked just great ... we’re going to take you through what we’re seeing quarter by quarter, and hopefully we continue to kind of beat that.” 

He added that he isn’t concerned about a consumer pullback in the beauty category and remains “bullish” on the broader environment.

“We are hearing kind of in the macro, ‘Hey, is the consumer being choosier?’ I’d say if they are, they’re choosing E.l.f.,” said Amin. “So we’re perhaps differently positioned, and if you look over the last 22 quarters, it didn’t matter what was happening in the category, whether it was the pandemic, whether it was inflationary pressures ... you name it, we’ve performed well throughout that, and I think it really comes down to our fundamental business model and how we’re different.” 

E.l.f., a digitally native beauty retailer that was founded in 2004, has gained a newfound relevance among Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers through marketing that lands with those younger shoppers and meets them where they are on places such as TikTok and Roblox. 

It’s known for creating value versions of prestige favorites, such as its new Bronzing Drops, which customers compare to Drunk Elephant’s product Sunshine Drops. The prestige skin care line offers its product for $38, while E.l.f.’s retails for just $12.

“These bronzing drops were the No. 1 requested item from our community, and our community comes to us and says, ‘Hey, there’s a prestige item there. We love them, but E.l.f., help us out. We can’t afford 38 bucks for bronzing drops,’” said Amin. “So we’ll study it. We’ll put our own E.l.f. twist on it and we’ll introduce ours at $12. Went to No. 1 right away on Elfcosmetics.com.”

The company doesn’t compare its products to any specific brands and instead lets its fan base fill in the blanks.

“Even though we don’t make the comparison ourselves, there’s like a thousand TikTok videos after we launch this product where people are doing side-by-sides or comparing it,” said Amin. “They’re like, it’s $12 versus the $38 item and actually, I like the E.l.f. one better, the quality’s better.’”

In July, the company expanded its collaboration with Roblox that enabled users ages 13 and up to buy limited edition products such as its “e.l.f. UP! Pets Hoodie” and mainstays such as its lip and SPF products. 

During the Olympics, it had splashy marketing campaigns with gymnast Gabby Douglas, a three-time gold medalist, and blind swimmer Anastasia “Tas” Pagonis. It also collaborated with actress Jameela Jamil on the launch of its new Bronzing Drops.

However, all that marketing doesn’t come cheap and has weighed on E.l.f.‘s bottom line. During the quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by roughly $88.6 million to $180.6 million, representing 56% of net sales. The spike in marketing spending contributed to a 10% drop in E.l.f.’s net income. 

Amin said the company is spending more on marketing this year than last but that was more a result of timing. He added E.l.f. is working to get marketing spend “more consistent” throughout the year as a percentage of sales. 

“We continue to invest more in marketing because it’s working,” said Amin. “Our marketing ROIs are multiples ahead of the category benchmarks, we’re growing very strong top line. We’re building awareness.”

62,2024-08-08,5,"Paramount Global reports streaming profit for first time ever as shares rise  Paramount Global is cutting 15% of its U.S. workforce, part of a broader cost-cutting plan as it prepares for a merger with Skydance Media.

Paramount has identified $500 million in cost savings, which include the head count reductions, as part of $2 billion in synergies related to its transaction with Skydance. The job cuts will affect the company’s marketing and communications department, as well as employees who work in finance, legal, technology, and other support functions, the company said during its earnings conference call Thursday.

Paramount agreed to a merger with Skydance Media last month. That deal includes a 45-day go-shop period — in which a special committee of Paramount’s board could find another buyer — that concludes later this month.

Earnings surged as the company’s streaming division swung to an unexpected profit — the first time Paramount has announced a profitable quarter for its direct-to-consumer business.

Shares climbed more than 5% in after-hours trading Thursday.

Here’s how Paramount performed in the quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted vs. 12 cents expected

Revenue: $6.81 billion vs. $7.21 billion expected
Revenue falls

Second-quarter revenue dropped 11% and missed analyst estimates as licensing, TV advertising and cable subscription sales dropped.

The revenue drop was the largest miss compared to analyst estimates since February 2020, according to LSEG data. Paramount attributed the miss to a decline in TV licensing revenue, which can be difficult for analysts to model given their start and end dates.

Paramount+ revenue grew 46% on year-over-year subscriber growth and higher prices. Paramount+ customers decreased 2.8 million from last quarter to 68 million as the company unwound a Korean partnership deal with entertainment company CJ ENM’s Tving streaming platform.

Paramount’s streaming division turned a profit for the quarter of $26 million after losing $424 million a year ago. Analysts had estimated a loss of $265 million this quarter.

Paramount reaffirmed it’s on track to reach U.S. profitability for Paramount+ in 2025. The streaming service has raised prices and cut content spend.

Paramount’s quarterly profit is helped by not having an NFL licensing charge for the period, which will kick in later in the year.

Shares have slumped 31% so far this year amid declines among cable subscribers and a soft linear TV advertising market.

Paramount also took a $6 billion one-time impairment charge associated with the decline in its cable networks. It comes on the heels of a $9.1 billion write-down from peer Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday.

The company had to take the charge as an adjustment forced by its transaction with Skydance.

So far I know: ENPH makes micro-inverters for solar panels and home energy management software that helps increase the energy efficiency. FSLR manufactures panels and solar power systems. Things I'd like to know are...

* Are ENPH's micro-inverters used for both residential and commercial projects? or are they more focused in one area over the other?
* Same question with FLSR's solar panels
* ENPH's micro-inverter technology has been a game changer and is ENPH's moat. Does FLSR have their own moat regarding their manufacturing in solar panels? 

I'm long in renewable solar technology and have \~7% of my portfolio in ENPH.

70,2024-08-08,17,"Under Armour sales fall after retailer cuts discounts, promotions  Under Armour on Thursday said quarterly sales fell 14% in North America, and adjusted its full-year profit guidance after settling a years-old securities lawsuit for $434 million.

Still, the company beat Wall Street’s expectations on the top and bottom lines.

Here’s how the athletic apparel company did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 1 cent adjusted vs. a loss of 8 cents expected

Revenue: $1.18 billion vs. $1.15 billion expected

In the three-months ended June 30, Under Armour reported a loss of $305.4 million, or 70 cents per share, compared with a profit of $10 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time expenses, it reported a profit of $4 million, or 1 cent per share.

Sales dropped to $1.18 billion, down about 10% from $1.32 billion a year earlier.

In late June, Under Armour agreed to settle a years-old securities lawsuit for $434 million about three weeks before a trial was slated to begin. In 2017, Under Armour was accused of defrauding shareholders about its revenue growth in a bid to meet Wall Street’s forecasts.

In a press release, the company said it was not admitting fault or wrongdoing but had agreed to end the case – about seven years after it was filed – because of “the costs and risks inherent in litigation.” Under Armour said it would pay the settlement using cash from its revolving credit facility.

The company now expects to swing to a loss in fiscal 2025. It’s forecasting losses per share to be between 53 cents and 56 cents and adjusted earnings per share to be between 19 cents and 22 cents.

Under Armour previously expected full-year earnings of 2 cents to 5 cents per share, and adjusted earnings between 18 cents and 21 cents per share.

The athletic apparel company is in the midst of a broad restructuring plan as it fights to regain relevance, reverse a sales slump and boost profits. Earlier this year, Under Armour said it would lay off an unknown number of workers, cut back promotions and discounts and streamline its assortment to be more competitive. It’s also looking to take a page out of Nike’s playbook and position Under Armour as a premium brand.

The restructuring came two months after former Marriott executive Stephanie Linnartz was ousted as Under Armour’s CEO and its founder Kevin Plank returned to the helm once again.

In a statement on Thursday, Plank said the company is “encouraged by early progress” in its efforts. But sales still tumbled across Under Armour’s business during the quarter.

In North America, Under Armour’s largest market, sales dropped 14% to $709 million, but came in better than the $669.1 million that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Wholesale revenue dropped 8% to $681 million, while direct-to-consumer sales declined 12% to $480 million.

Sales at stores owned and operated by Under Armour fell 3%, while online sales plunged a staggering 25% — a drop off the company attributed to “planned decreases in promotion activities.”

Apparel revenue fell 8%, footwear sales dropped 15% and accessories revenue slid 5%.

As Under Armour looks to get back to growth and position itself as a premium retailer in a crowded athletic apparel space, it’s adding fresh talent and expanding into sustainable fashion.

On Tuesday, the retailer announced it had acquired sustainable fashion brand Unless Collective and will bring on the brand’s founder, former Adidas-exec Eric Liedtke, as executive vice president of brand strategy. 

“Eric will … be globally accountable for amplifying Under Armour’s brand identity and storytelling, its comprehensive strategic planning process, and executing transformational initiatives that accelerate growth for UA while continuing to lead and curate, UNLESS,” a press release about the acquisition said.

“He will report to President & CEO Kevin Plank and oversee UA’s brand presence through category marketing, consumer intelligence, creative, marketing operations, loyalty, social media, sports marketing, and all strategy functions,” the release said.

Unless bills itself as “the world’s first all-plant, zero-plastic regenerative fashion brand” and said it was created to prove that plants could replace plastics in the manufacturing of apparel and footwear.

249,2024-08-08,55,"Eli Lilly blows past estimates, hikes guidance as Zepbound, Mounjaro sales soar  Eli Lilly on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that blew past expectations and hiked its full-year revenue outlook by $3 billion as sales of its blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss injection Zepbound spike.

Shares of Eli Lilly jumped more than 9% in premarket trading Thursday.

The drugmaker now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $16.10 to $16.60, up from a previous guidance of $13.50 to $14 per share.

The company also expects revenue for the year to come in between $45.4 billion and $46.6 billion, an increase of $3 billion at both ends of the range.

The results come almost one week after the Food and Drug Administration said all doses of Zepbound and Mounjaro are available in the U.S. after extended shortages. Demand has far outstripped supply for those incretin drugs, which mimic hormones produced in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite and regulate their blood sugar.

Here’s what Eli Lilly reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

Earnings per share: $3.92 adjusted vs. $2.60 expected

Revenue: $11.30 billion vs. $9.92 billion expected

The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $2.97 billion, or $3.28 a share, for the second quarter. That compares with a profit of $1.76 billion, or $1.95 a share, a year earlier. 

Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $3.92 per share for the second quarter of 2024.

The company posted second-quarter revenue of $11.30 billion, up 36% from the same period a year ago. 

Shares of Eli Lilly are up more than 30% this year after jumping almost 60% in 2023 due to the soaring demand for the company’s weight loss and diabetes drugs – and increased investor interest in their potential as treatments for other health conditions. That popularity comes despite their hefty monthly price tags, inconsistent insurance coverage and intermittent supply shortages. 

With a market cap of more than $730 billion, Eli Lilly is the largest pharmaceutical company based in the U.S.

41,2024-08-08,21,"Thoughts on Axon (AXON)? Axon is up 18% today following yesterday’s earning report. I’ve owned Axon since 2017 when I noticed that just about every police department getting body cameras was going with them, and absolutely love this company.

They make the bulk of their money using a SAS subscription model, licensing their evidence.com body camera video storage to law enforcement agencies. Evidence.com has since become a must-have for law enforcement agencies, District Attorney Offices, and even public defender offices and private defense attorneys are buying subscriptions to easily receive and review body camera evidence.

The company is a cash cow. At this point, with the widespread adoption of Axon body cameras, the company has a ton of government contracts, and the government agencies need the evidence.com subscriptions to maintain their evidence. The competition in the body camera market sucks, and the costs to switch are enormous. Axon can pretty much charge whatever they want, and they have all these government contracts with places that aren’t going to be able to easily get rid of them. Their costs to operate this type of business are pretty small.

Those are my thoughts (especially as a Deputy DA who’s been using their services for years now). I’m curious what everybody else thinks about this company. "

2,2024-08-07,6,"Possible Bullish Thesis on Hertz I know, I know - investors or traders have gotten the shaft on this ticker, but hear me out.

Hertz ran into *more* issues post-covid travel restrictions when Tesla marked down the price of their vehicles and accelerated the depreciation of said assets on Hertz's books (PP&E on balance sheet). There has also been seasonality regarding sales, profitability, and consumer spending is relatively contractionary for the overall sector. Their earnings have obviously been unsatisfactory, and there's been leadership and financial restructuring to *try* get things back on track. IDC about any of that really, what I care about is the strategic mistake to accelerate the sale of their EVs given the low utilization rate of EVs by their customers in the Hertz fleet.

Hertz is positioned to have one of the largest robo-taxi fleets in the world, second to only Tesla themselves to my knowledge, and Tesla can't position fleets everywhere *yet*.

* After Tesla began seriously teasing investors with the idea, companies like Lyft and Uber corrected, hard, while Hertz reached a bottom @ <$3/share with upside volatility characteristics.
* Hertz is trading at well below book value, and the PP&E depreciation will decelerate once Teslas become a profitable investment (i.e., rideshare fees > depreciation & maintenance).
* The low utilization rate by Hertz's customers will be moot if the fleet is automatically participating robo-ridesharing. They will be utilized, at least more so than previous reporting periods.

If Hertz slows or ceases selling their EVs for short term liquidity, once robo-taxi platform rolls out, Hertz has a new revenue stream with their existing assets. The depreciation will slow or reverse, their low utilization rate will subside, and their profitability will increase dramatically.

There's a lot of ***ifs*** in this scenario, but if this happens, I think Hertz will *at least* trade at book value ( > $6.25/share) indicating over 75% upside by the end of this year. If profitability continued to grow from robo-taxi fees, and if Hertz accomplishes higher profitability over the next several years from this while increasing utilization rates, their EPS will go profitable again which if sustainable we're looking at over $10-20/share in the coming years.

What are your thoughts?  
Do you see value in this thesis?  
Do you have a strong counter argument?

Looking forward to your thoughts. Thanks!"
391,2024-08-07,75,"Warner Bros. Discovery stock falls as it writes down $9.1 billion  Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock dropped Wednesday after it reported a $9.1 billion write-down on its TV networks and missed analyst estimates on revenue.

Here is how Warner Bros. Discovery performed, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Loss per share: 36 cents vs. a loss of 22 cents expected

Revenue: $9.7 billion vs. $10.07 billion expected

The company’s shares were down roughly 9% in aftermarket trading.

Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday reported the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, which was triggered by the reevaluation of the book value of the TV networks segment. The book value was higher than the market value as traditional TV networks continue to see customers flee and advertisers are opting to spend on digital and streaming instead.

“While I am certainly not dismissive of the magnitude of this impairment, I believe it’s equally important to recognize that the flip side of this reflects the value shift across business models,” said CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels on Wednesday’s earnings call, adding that the company is focusing on growth in the studios and streaming units.

He said Warner Bros. Discovery’s balance sheet carries a significant amount of goodwill stemming from mergers and acquisitions, namely the combination of Warner Bros. and Discovery in 2022.

“It’s fair to say that even two years ago market valuations and prevailing conditions for legacy media companies were quite different than they are today, and this impairment acknowledges this and better aligns our carrying values with our future outlook,” CEO David Zaslav said on Wednesday’s call.

Executives highlighted Warner Bros. Discovery’s continued mission of paying down debt, much of which stems from the 2022 merger. During the second quarter the company paid down $1.8 billion in debt. As of June 30, it had $41.4 billion in gross debt and $3.6 billion cash on hand.

The company also noted uncertainty surrounding future sports rights renewals, including the NBA. Warner Bros. Discovery sued the NBA in July, looking to forcibly invoke its matching rights on a package of games earmarked for Amazon’s Prime Video as part of the league’s new media rights deal.

Revenue for Warner Bros. Discovery’s TV networks — a portfolio that includes TBS, TNT, Discovery and TLC — was down 8% to $5.27 billion during the second quarter, with both distribution and advertising revenue down in the segment.

However, the company’s streaming business, centered around the platform Max, was a bright spot.

The company said Wednesday it added 3.6 million subscribers during the quarter ended June 30, bringing its total number of global streaming customers to 103.3 million.

The international expansion lifting subscriber growth, as well as increased ad spending on streaming, is propelling its streaming business toward profitability, executives said Wednesday, with the expectation that it would continue.

Zaslav also touted the streaming bundles Warner Bros. Discovery is forming — an entertainment pairing with Disney’s Disney+ and Hulu — and a sports bundle with Disney’s ESPN and Fox set to launch this fall.

Still, direct-to-consumer streaming revenue decreased 5% to $2.57 billion, driven by content revenue dropping 70% due to a lower volume of third-party licensing deals. Yet advertising revenue for streaming was up 99%, the company said, driven by higher domestic engagement on Max, and ad-supported subscriber growth. Global revenue also increased 4% driven by the ad tier.

Total revenue for the quarter was down 6% to $9.7 billion. Total adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization decreased 15% to $1.8 billion.

8,2024-08-07,44,"What is the best way to diversify an aggressive portfolio? Do I have no choice but to buy bonds or gold? Like many investors in reddit and the market overall, I find myself in a position where my portfolio is heavily tilted towards big tech and the Mag 7.

I'm a young investor (early 30s) with a lengthy time horizon so I have no problem with my high degree of tech exposure since tech is often the sector with the most growth potential in the long run.

Given recent events and the fact that a large portion of my 2024 gains have been wiped out in the last three weeks, I'm interested in finding ways to diversify my portfolio, while still remaining relatively aggressive overall. I know that this may be a bit of an oxymoron as diversification often caps your overall potential growth, but I'm sure there is a balance that can be struck.

My problem is that I'm not sure how to best go about finding that balance and diversifying. 

My portfolio is already something like ~40% VOO and ~25% QQQ, with a decent portion of the remainder in individual Mag 7 and other tech and telecom stocks. I thought that by having more than half of the portfolio in VOO and QQQ that this was decent diversification enough, however the Mag 7 is such a major component of both of these index funds, that I'm basically double and tripling down on the performance of big tech companies. I liked this composition when it was booming of course, but the last several weeks are a stark reminder that a little bit of defensiveness is never a bad idea.

In reading about diversification options, so many resources tells you to consider bonds and T-bills, or gold, but in order to diversify enough that it would have helped me in a situation like the one we've been in recently, I'd have had to put in a large enough fraction of my portfolio into these investments that my aggressive approach would have seriously been undercut in doing so.

I've considered adding more exposure to other sectors of the market such as utilities, energy and industrials, but I feel like I don't know quite enough about these sectors and how they behave in market downturns to properly make informed selections. I do like utilities and energy because they are more non-cyclical than tech and telecom.

How are you all approaching the matter of diversification while also remaining relatively aggressive. I'd love to find a sector of the market that is completely uncorrelated to tech that I could put a fair amount of money into and thereby cut my risk down by a lot while still maintaining relatively similar gains (Ray Dalio has a fantastic spiel on this approach).

Thanks for reading, appreciate the input!"
1397,2024-08-07,216,"Warren Buffett now owns more T-bills than the Federal Reserve  Berkshire Hathaway now owns more in Treasury bills than the U.S. Federal Reserve as Warren Buffett builds up his cash fortress to a record level.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate held $234.6 billion in short-term investments in Treasury bills at the end of the second quarter, while it owned more than $42 billion of cash and cash equivalents that included T-bills with maturities of three months or less, according to its quarterly financial report.

That compared with $195.3 billion in T-bills that the Fed owned as of July 31. The central bank held $4.4 trillion in Treasury securities that include notes, bonds and inflation-linked securities. The Fed was a big buyer of the government’s debt during the pandemic and is always one of the largest holders of Treasurys as part of its effort to keep liquidity in the markets.

Buffett, 93, pulled off a surprising and yet prescient move by selling big chunks in stock holdings including Apple last quarter, ahead of a drastic global sell-off this week. Berkshire has been a seller of stocks for seven quarters straight, but that selling accelerated in the last period with Buffett shedding more than $75 billion in equities in the second quarter.

Many loyal Buffett watchers viewed the decision to dump his top holdings as a wake-up call with the Oracle of Omaha seemingly turning bearish on the economy and the markets.

Buffett has noted in the past during times of crisis that he’ll buy Treasury bills directly at auction. The government sells T-bills for terms ranging from four to 52 weeks.

Buffett’s gigantic war chest has been earning sizeable returns thanks to the pop in Treasury yields over the past two years. If invested in 3-month Treasury bills at about 5%, $200 billion in cash would generate about $10 billion a year, or $2.5 billion a quarter.

After the Covid-19 pandemic rattled markets, the central bank bought about $5 trillion of Treasurys and mortgage bonds to help aid the economy. But the Fed has been shrinking its asset holdings since June 2022, in a program widely known as quantitative tightening.

The Fed seeks to promote maximum employment and stable prices by independently setting monetary policy. It includes buying and selling Treasury securities held by the public to control the money supply and interest rates.

0,2024-08-07,19,"Is Lucid stock a good investment at the current price point? The Saudis spent 5.4B to get 60% of Lucid. If you calculated backward, they spent an equivalent of $3.93 per share (probably more for fees) to get the privilege of an insider deal.  This Monday, the PIF affiliate announced it would buy $750 million of convertible preferred stock via private placement and provide a $750 million unsecured delayed draw term loan facility for an additional 1.5B injection into Lucid.  Yep, the EV market is not doing well with high interest rates and decreased demand for EVs. However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel:

* Lucid high-price tech makes it a tough sale with the high interest rate given Americans usually lease or mortgage their cars. However, It will be significantly different when all the cars are more affordable if the interest rate comes down later this year. EV competition is hot but Lucid makes one of the best luxury high-tech EVs. Lucid truly makes great cars and the new models' prices are significantly more affordable than the first Lucid models.
* The 2025 Air Pure is the most energy-efficient mass-production car ever, with 5 miles per kWh and a record 146 MPGe EPA estimated range rating.  The Lucid Air Pure starts at $69,900, down from around $90,000 when it launched.
* Lucid plans to start Gravity production in late 2024. It will be available starting at under $80,000.  The much-awaited Gravity SUV will extend Lucid into the best-selling car segment.
* The new $1.5 billion capital raise with PIF will extend Lucid's cash until the fourth quarter of 2025.
* The factory in Saudi Arabia is planned to have an annual capacity of making 150,000 vehicles per year when it is completed.
* The Government of Saudi Arabia, under which the Government will purchase up to 100,000 vehicles over a ten-year period, with an initial commitment to purchase 50,000 vehicles and an option to purchase up to an additional 50,000 vehicles over the same period. Lucid will support the Saudi Green Initiative’s imperative to ensure that 30% of new car sales in Saudi Arabia are electric by 2030.  This would help push up the future earnings significantly.
* Saudis will most likely make more efforts in financial backing to help Lucid's turnaround given they own a majority stack of the company.  The injection of new 1.5B makes it possible that they may even privatize Lucid if things do go sour.
* Alternatively, Lucid may be bought by another car company at a significant discount for its advanced luxury tech with huge retailer loss but at a price that beats the Saudis' $3.93+/share investment.

I doubt that PIF would let Lucid go without a fight. Lucid now has enough money to last until the 4th quarter of 2025. The company may just be able to pull it off with the backing of PIF which has an estimated 925B in assets, extension into the lucrative SUV segment, and especially if the interest rate goes down."

19,2024-08-07,1,"SoftBank swings back to gains at Vision Fund tech arm, announces up to $3.4 billion share buyback  SoftBank Group booked a 1.9 billion yen ($12.9 million) investment gain on its Vision Fund tech investment arm in the company’s fiscal first quarter ended in June, swinging back into the black.

Gains in some of SoftBank’s Chinese portfolio companies — including TikTok owner ByteDance — helped offset losses from other firms like AutoStore and Symbotic.

However, the Vision Fund segment as a whole posted a 204.3 billion yen loss, after being in profit in the same quarter last year. The segment total takes into account other performance beyond investment, such as administrative expenses, as well as gains and losses attributable to third-party investors.

The Japanese giant also announced it would buy back up to 6.8% of shares available in the company amounting to up to 500 billion yen ($3.4 billion).

In the year ago quarter, SoftBank posted 159.77 billion yen gain in its Vision Fund. In the March quarter, SoftBank posted a loss of 57.53 billion yen in its flagship tech investment arm.

SoftBank posted its first full-year gain since 2021 at the Vision Fund in the fiscal year ended March as it benefitted from a rally in technology stocks and within some of its key holdings.

The Vision Fund’s recent success is also due in large part to the success of the initial public offering of chip designer Arm last year, of which SoftBank owns around 90% of the company.

However, SoftBank is once more contending with volatile public markets. On Monday, SoftBank shares tanked nearly 19% in a day amid a broader fall in Japanese stocks stoked by an interest rate rise from the Bank of Japan last week.

Japan’s main indexes did rebound on Tuesday, however. But global markets remain volatile as investors remain concerned about the state of the world economy and high valuations in part driven by technology stocks.

SoftBank, which itself has been marred by bad bets over the past few years, is trying to position itself to investors as a key player in the artificial intelligence boom. The company’s management have highlighted its investments in companies like Arm and self-driving startup Wayve as indiciations that the Japanese giant is poised to capitalize on the growth of AI.

SoftBank’s high-profile founder Masayoshi Son, who has been largely out of the public eye for a while, returned this year to deliver his vision of AI which he predicts will be 10,000 times smarter than humans in 10 years.

Buyback pressure

SoftBank’s buyback announcement comes amid growing pressure from shareholders who have been concerned that the Japanese company’s market capitalization is significantly lower than the value of assets its invested in or owns.

Buybacks are one way to potentially boost a company’s share price.

Investment firm Elliott Management rebuilt its position in SoftBank and was pushing the company to embark on a share repurchase program, CNBC reported in June.

For its part, SoftBank said it “has decided to repurchase its own shares as part of its shareholder return initiatives.”

In a press conference on Wednesday, SoftBank finance chief Yoshimitsu Goto declined to discuss talks with individual investors but said that the buyback was the company’s own decision.

“We have made our own decision after discussions at the board level. So we are not a company that has made a decision after impact from somebody else,” Goto said.

Alibaba boost

Net sales for SoftBank Group in the June quarter rose 9.3% year-on-year to 1.7 trillion yen, beating analyst expectations. Net profit came in at 10.5 billion yen after a 316.2 billion yen loss in the year ago quarter.

SoftBank has been partly helped by a 235.7 billion investment gain on Alibaba shares and a 179.1 billion return on T-Mobile shares.

The tech conglomerate grew into one of Japan’s biggest companies thanks to Son’s early bet on Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2000, which has boomed over the coming years. The firm has been cutting its Alibaba stake since, as it looks to use the money to fund bets on AI.

111,2024-08-07,14,"Sony profit jumps 10%, beating estimates on growth in gaming software, music  Sony on Wednesday reported a 10% jump in operating profit in the fiscal first quarter, beating analyst expectations after seeing strong growth in its gaming, music and imaging chip businesses.

The Japanese technology giant’s music division, in particular, got a boost during the quarter as the release of R&B star Beyonce’s new “Cowboy Carter” album boosted its performance.

Here’s how Sony did in the June quarter, versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: 3.01 trillion Japanese yen ($20.5 billion), versus 2.8 trillion yen expected. That marked a 2% rise from the same period a year ago.

Operating profit: 279.11 billion yen ($1.9 billion), versus 275.35 billion yen expected. That was up 10% year-over-year.

In an earnings release Wednesday, Sony said that its first-quarter sales benefited from “significant increases” in game and network services, music, and imaging and sensing solutions.

Gaming, for which Sony is well-known thanks to its popular PlayStation consoles, banked revenues of 864.9 billion yen in the quarter, up 12% from 771.9 billion yen a year ago.

Meanwhile, Sony’s music and imaging sensor divisions saw revenue jumps of 23% and 21%, respectively.

For full-year 2024, Sony revised its forecast upward saying it now expects to hit 12.6 billion yen of sales. That’s up 2% from what the company was previously guiding.

Sony also upped its operating profit forecast by 3%, noting it expects to reach 1.3 trillion yen in consolidated operating profit for the full year.

Sony gets a boost from Beyonce

Within the music division, Sony got a boost from newly released recorded music during the June quarter — including from U.S. singer Beyonce.

Sony name-dropped Beyonce’s “Cowboy Carter,” Future & Metro Boomin’s “We Don’t Trust You,” and SZA’s “SOS” as its top 10 best-selling recorded music projects for Sony Music Entertainment in the first quarter.

“Cowboy Carter,” released in March, pays homage to Beyonce’s home town, Houston, Texas. It is one of the biggest releases of 2024 so far, alongside Taylor Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department.”

In May, the Japanese consumer electronics power house reported a disappointing full-year 2023, narrowly missing its target for annual PlayStation 5 sales. The firm at the time reported total unit sales of 20.8 million in the fiscal year 2023, lower than the 21 million units Sony said it was expecting.

On Wednesday, Sony said it sold 2.4 million PlayStation 5 units in the June quarter. That was down from the 3.3 million PlayStation 5 units Sony sold in the same period a year ago.

However, the company got a boost from software sales even as hardware revenue lagged. Sony said it saw an increase in sales of first-party game software titles and in sales from network services — primarily its PlayStation Plus subscription service.

PlayStation Plus is a membership program that gives players access to online multiplayer and provides access to a number of free titles each month.

The numbers show a longer-term shift for the console industry, which has seen a trend of gamers increasingly turning to digital downloads and subscription services.

This includes offerings that enable streaming games via the cloud, a technology that forgoes the need for expensive hardware.

Shares of Sony closed flat in Tokyo Wednesday. Japanese shares have had a turbulent few days this week, with the blue-chip Nikkei on Monday logging its worst day since the 1987 Black Monday market crash.

37,2024-08-07,21,"CVS slashes profit outlook on higher medical costs, says top Aetna exec will leave  CVS Health on Wednesday reported second-quarter earnings that topped expectations, but slashed its full-year profit outlook, citing higher medical costs that have been squeezing the U.S. insurance industry. 

The company also said Aetna President Brian Kane, the top executive at the insurance unit, will leave the company. CVS CEO Karen Lynch will take over management of the business and CFO Thomas Cowhey will also help to oversee it.

The retail drugstore chain expects 2024 adjusted earnings of $6.40 to $6.65 per share, down from a previous guidance of at least $7 per share. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting full-year adjusted profit of $6.97 per share. 

CVS also cut its unadjusted earnings guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.20 per share, down from at least $5.64 per share. 

It marks the third consecutive quarter that the company has lowered its 2024 profit guidance. 

CVS said its new outlook reflects continued pressure on its health insurance segment, which is seeing increased medical costs and the “unfavorable impact” of the company’s Medicare Advantage star ratings. Those ratings help Medicare patients compare the quality of Medicare health and drug plans. 

CVS owns health insurer Aetna. The company’s insurance division includes plans by Aetna for the Affordable Care Act, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, as well as dental and vision.

Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Elevance Health have seen medical costs spike as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. 

Medicare Advantage, a privately run health insurance plan contracted by the federal Medicare program, has long been a driver of growth and profits for the insurance industry. But Wall Street has become more concerned about the runaway costs associated with those plans, which cover more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries. 

Here’s what CVS reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

Earnings per share: $1.83 adjusted vs. $1.73 expected

Revenue: $91.23 billion vs. $91.5 billion expected 

The company posted net income of $1.77 billion, or $1.41 per share, for the second quarter. That compares with net income of $1.90 billion, or $1.48 per share, for the year-earlier period. 

Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets and capital losses, adjusted earnings per share were $1.83 for the quarter.

CVS reported sales of $91.23 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago due to growth in its pharmacy business and insurance unit. 

The company noted that sales in its health services segment, which includes its pharmacy benefit manager Caremark, declined during the second quarter. CVS cited pharmacy client price improvements and the loss of a large unnamed client.  

Caremark negotiates drug discounts with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans, along with health-care services delivered in medical clinics, through telehealth and at home.

Tyson Foods in January said it had dropped CVS Caremark and instead chose PBM startup Rightway to manage drug benefits for its 140,000 employees starting in 2024. Months earlier, Blue Shield of California, one of the largest insurers in the U.S.’s most populous state, also dropped Caremark to partner with Amazon Pharmacy and Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs company. 

Those decisions represent a larger upheaval in the health-care industry, as startups and the government work to increase transparency and lower costs for U.S. patients. 

Pressure on insurance unit

CVS’ insurance segment generated $32.48 billion in revenue during the quarter, a more than 21% increase from the second quarter of 2023.

Sales were in line with analysts’ estimate of $32.37 billion for the period, according to StreetAccount. 

But the division reported adjusted operating income of just $938 million for the second quarter. That is below analysts’ expectation of $962 million for the period, StreetAccount said. 

The insurance unit’s medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — increased to 89.6% from 86.2% a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability.

That ratio came in lower than the 90.1% that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. 

CVS’s health services segment generated $42.17 billion in revenue for the quarter, down nearly 9% compared with the same quarter in 2023. 

Those sales were above analysts’ estimate of $41.25 billion for the period, according to StreetAccount. 

The health services division processed 471.2 million pharmacy claims during the quarter, down from 576.6 million during the year-ago period. 

CVS’ pharmacy and consumer wellness division booked $29.84 billion in sales for the first quarter, up more than 3% from the same period a year earlier. That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS’ more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing. 

Analysts had expected the division to bring in $30.22 billion in sales, according to StreetAccount.

The rise was partly driven by increased prescription volume, CVS said. Pharmacy reimbursement pressure, the launch of new generic drugs and decreased front-store volume, among other factors, weighed on the unit’s sales.

227,2024-08-07,93,"Disney beats estimates as combined streaming services turn a profit  Disney reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings Wednesday, topping analyst estimates as its combined streaming businesses turned a profit earlier than expected.

Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.39 adjusted vs. $1.19 expected

Revenue: $23.16 billion vs. $23.07 billion expected

The company’s total segment operating income increased 19% to $4.225 billion compared with the same period last year, led by the positive results for Disney’s entertainment unit, particularly streaming. 

Disney’s combined streaming business, which consists of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, together turned a profit for the first time — and it happened a quarter earlier than the company had expected.

The combined streaming business posted an operating profit of $47 million compared with a loss of $512 million in the same quarter last year. However, without ESPN+, the direct-to-consumer streaming unit reported a loss of $19 million.

Meanwhile, last quarter, Disney+ and Hulu together turned a profit, but when combined with ESPN+, the streaming businesses suffered a loss.

Disney recently changed how it reports its segments, with ESPN falling under its sports unit, and Disney+ and Hulu being counted as part of the direct-to-consumer entertainment segment. Disney and its peers have been focused on streaming reaching profitability as the traditional TV business bleeds customers.

Disney+ Core subscribers — which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region — increased by 1% to 118.3 million, despite the company’s earlier guidance it wouldn’t add new customers during the fiscal third quarter. Total Hulu subscribers grew 2% to 51.1 million.

Revenue for the entertainment segment was up 4% to $10.58 billion, driven largely by subscription revenue growth due to price increases and customer growth for Disney+ Core. The company announced further streaming price hikes on Tuesday. Revenue for the traditional TV networks was down 7%.

Disney’s overall revenue increased 4% to $23.155 billion compared with the same period last year.

However, while Disney’s entertainment and sports divisions drove earnings, the U.S. theme parks business was impacted by slowing consumer demand and inflation.

“The portfolio is working well,” Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said. “Yes there was softness in the domestic parks, but the entertainment division’s profit tripled in the quarter.” 

Disney’s parks have been a key profit driver, and the company has pledged to spend roughly $60 billion on its theme parks over the next decade.

Revenue for the overall experiences unit, which includes domestic and international parks and experiences, as well as consumer products, was up 2% to $8.386 billion. 

Operating income for U.S. parks was down 6%, while international parks operating income was up 2%. The company attributed the decrease in operating income at the domestic parks to higher costs driven by inflation, as well as increased technology spending and new guest offerings.

This carried over from the previous quarter, when Disneyland Resort in California was under pressure with lower profits, with executives citing similar reasons.

Last month Comcast’s earnings were weighed down by its Universal theme parks, which the company attributed to increased competition from cruises and international tourism. Despite this, Comcast executives said they remained “bullish” on the business, especially with a new theme park opening in 2025.

0,2024-08-07,12,"FED’s next decision in September Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking a lot about the recent sell-off in the stock market and the role of the Fed in all this. Here’s my take, and I’d love to hear your thoughts!

So, here’s the situation: Japanese banks have been lending to investors, who then invest globally where returns are better than in Japan. With the yen getting stronger, these investments aren’t as profitable anymore, so everyone’s selling off.

Here’s the Fed’s dilemma: Cutting rates could boost the stock market by making borrowing cheaper, but it would weaken the dollar, worsening the situation with the yen and those global investments.

So, it looks like the Fed can’t really fix the stock market by just adjusting rates, because every move has its own set of complications.



Edit 1: “fix the stock market” was a poor choice of words.

Edit 2: Many people are missing my point. What I am trying to say is that even if the Fed cut rates in September the stock market will still go down because the pressure of a strong Yen. "

52,2024-08-07,63,"Vanguard Thinks Bonds Can Beat Stocks Over Next Decade The stock market has had a rough few days. It could be just a taste of the sluggish returns investors can expect over the next decade, according to Vanguard.

On Monday the S&P 500 fell 3% as worries about the U.S. economy was spread around the globe. And while the index has still returned 20% in the past 12 months, it may be no accident the market is starting to look shaky.

Today’s high stock prices may dog the market for years to come, Vanguard says. What’s more, the investing giant thinks bonds are poised to outpace stocks over the next decade.

The stock market has enjoyed outsize gains thanks to big tech profits, says Vanguard economist Kevin Khang. These days, however, valuations are “pretty stretched.”

Meanwhile bonds, benefiting from the Fed’s effort to raise rates, look better than they have in years. In contrast to stocks, bonds are very attractive, he adds.

In line with this thinking, Vanguard recently forecast annual U.S. stock returns over the next decade of 3.4% to 5.4%. By contrast, Vanguard’s outlook for U.S. bonds is a rosier 4.6% to 5.6%, according to the firm’s midyear outlook published last month.

Picking bonds to beat stocks for as long as a decade is a bold call for a firm typically known for sticking to tried-and-true investing rules. While far more volatile, stocks have delivered average returns of about 10.2% over the past 100 years. That is roughly double the average return for bonds.

Vanguard’s hesitation over stocks is largely tied to price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, Khang says. While the S&P 500’s decadeslong historical P/E is about 19, today stocks are trading at 25.

Of course, price-to-earnings ratios can remain out of whack for years at a time. One popular valuation metric, the Shiller P/E, has been above its long-term average for upward of a decade. Still, Vanguard argues the stock market will eventually return to the norm, which suggests tepid stock returns in coming years.

Khang notes elevated stock prices are underpinned by genuinely outsize earnings growth among big stocks such as the Magnificent 7. Despite their enormous size, these companies have managed to rack up double-digit profit gains in recent years.

Still, while these companies may yet prove transformational to the economy, Khang says their earnings momentum will eventually fade. That has happened historically–following the dot-com bubble, with the Nifty Fifty stocks in the 1960s, and with companies that powered electrification in the 1920s.

“Earnings growth can’t just continue to go grow at that level,” Kang says.

Unlike stock investors, bondholders are coming off some difficult years. Bond prices, which move inversely to interest rates, languished as the Federal Reserve spent much of 2022 and 2023 raising rates.

Now, however, bond investors are much better positioned. Bonds offer attractive yields, and enjoy the prospect of a tailwind once the Fed does start to lower rates, as most Wall Street traders believe, in September.

Khang says Vanguard arrives at its 10-year forecast for roughly 5% annual bond returns by taking today’s 10-year Treasury yield of just under 4% and tacking on a risk premium of roughly one percentage point.

Indeed, the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund 
VCIT boasts a yield of 5.1%, with an average duration of 7.4 years—suggesting investors willing to lock in those rates today will enjoy them into at least the 2030s.

3525,2024-08-06,191,"Elon Musk’s support for Trump pushes a corporate customer away from Tesla  European drugstore giant Rossmann announced Tuesday it will no longer buy Tesla’s electric vehicles for its fleet, effective immediately, citing CEO Elon Musk’s pro-Trump political support.

Rossmann, based in Germany, said in a statement that its decision was “based on the incompatibility between the statements of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the values ​​that Tesla represents with its products.”

“Elon Musk makes no secret of his support for Donald Trump,” Raoul Rossmann, a spokesperson for the company, said in a statement. “Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax - this attitude is in stark contrast to Tesla’s mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars.”

While Rossmann only purchases about 180 electric vehicles a year — and only had 38 Teslas in its fleet according to Bloomberg — the company’s decision to cut all Tesla EV purchases shows that Musk’s political decisions have begun to impact the automaker well beyond the U.S.

Musk formally endorsed Trump last month, and said he was contributing funds to a pro-Trump group he helped create called America PAC. Musk is also slated to interview the former president, Trump announced on Tuesday.

During a debate with President Biden in June, former President Trump dodged questions about what he would do, if anything, to combat climate change. And Trump has called climate change a “hoax.” He has also promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate agreement, as he did during his presidency, if he is re-elected in November.

According to ongoing research by Morning Consult, Republicans in the U.S. began to view Musk more favorably following his leveraged buyout of Twitter (now known as X) in late 2022. However, this has not driven an increase in Republican’s “purchasing consideration” of electric vehicles here. According to Pew Research, Musk’s reputation with left-leaning voters has declined even though they are far more likely to purchase an EV.

Rossman’s decision follows a recent survey that found a deterioration in Tesla’s brand, attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” While Tesla’s revenue increased 2% during the second quarter, automotive revenue dropped 7% to $19.9 billion from $21.27 billion in the same quarter a year ago.

Tesla opened a factory in 2022 in Brandenburg, Germany (outside of Berlin) and employs thousands in the country. At the end of 2023, the drugstore chain Rossmann reported that it had more than 4,700 stores and more than 60,000 employees with about half in Germany.

Tesla has faced protests by environmental activists in Germany who took issue with the company’s plans to cut down part of a forest and to use water for manufacturing in Brandenburg. Musk lashed out at protesters there, saying on X in March they’re “either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they’re puppets of those who don’t have good environmental goals.”

Tesla, Musk and representatives for Rossmann did not respond to requests for further details on Thursday morning.

118,2024-08-06,42,"Rivian tops Wall Street's second-quarter expectations amid cost cuts  Rivian Automotive beat Wall Street’s top- and bottom-line expectations for the second quarter as the electric vehicle maker continues to take costs out of its business.

Here is how the company did, compared to estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: Loss of $1.13 adjusted vs. loss of $1.21 expected

Automotive revenue: $1.16 billion vs. $1.14 billion expected

The company’s adjusted net losses widened during the second quarter to $1.46 billion, or a loss of $1.46 per share, compared with a year earlier of $1.2 billion, or a loss of $1.27 per share.

Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA was about level from the same period as a year ago at a loss of $860 million.

Rivian on Tuesday reaffirmed its 2024 guidance of 57,000 total units of production, a loss of $2.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in capital expenditures.

Through the first six months of the year Rivian produced about 23,600 vehicles, including only 9,162 during the second quarter due to downtime at the company’s plant to retool and reduce costs.

The second-quarter results come more than a month after Rivian held an investor day that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software. The event came days after Rivian announced plans for Volkswagen to invest up to $5 billion in the EV startup, starting with an initial investment of $1 billion.

Shares of Rivian are off 37% this year amid slower-than-expected demand for EVs as well as Rivian’s significant cash burn. The stock closed Tuesday at $14.80, up 1.3%.

Rivian, which is still losing thousands of dollars for every vehicle it makes, has been focused on reducing costs. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in June that efficiencies earlier this year in products and manufacturing are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming “R2” vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026.

Rivian’s expenditures through the first half of the year were $537 million, including $283 million during the second quarter.

Rivian ended the second quarter with $9.18 billion in total liquidity, including $7.87 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

6,2024-08-06,94,"Getting a gut check on INTC YTD INTC is down about 58.5% as of last check and in the short run it's outlook looks terrible especially given the negative press with their core product desktop CPUs.

However I can't help but draw parallels to how AMD was looking about 10 years ago trading for under $2 and now for roughly $130. 

In some ways I feel Intel has a much better potential to bounce back than even AMD did. 

Chief of which being how incredibly wide their business is. 
While AMD is chiefly focused on CPUs and GPUs, Intel has both plus a much stronger presence in wireless chips, storage hardware, the USB patent and may others that AMD does / did not have. In fact if you open up an Intel based desktop or laptop there's a good chance the majority of the comments could be Intel based. 

Plus they do have manufacturing capabilities that AMD does not have and major sponsorship from the US government to bring that production to the US as a strategicly important product manufacturing firm. 

This seems to be prime opportunity for Intel to consolidate to their core business and spin off smaller divisions to generate cash to grow their core business back to profitability. And
AMD and Intel functioning as essentially a duopoly in the x86 space neither can really go away. 

However, things are different now than with the recovery of AMD. Chief of which being the rise of ARM and alternatives to the x86 architecture like with Apple silicone. 

I keep going back on if INTC is the best value buy opportunity in a while or it really is the hot garbage the recent controversy about their 13th and 14th Gen CPUs failing in mass make it seem to be. 

Note, I'm just a casual stocks speculator and PC gaming enthusiast and really should dig into their balance sheets more. 


Edit: just to be clear, I haven't bought into INTC yet, just testing the waters and getting a gut check before I make any moves. 

I feel confident they will recover eventually but, as I mentioned in a comment here, I'm concerned about to what extent and how soon. Is the opportunity cost of buying and holding now or even buying long term call options worth it compared to just holding the cash in a money market or investing in SPY? That opportunity cost I'm not as confident on."

46,2024-08-06,5,"Uber reports better-than-expected earnings and revenue for second quarter  Uber on Tuesday reported second-quarter earnings results that topped Wall Street estimates. The stock rose about 6% at the market open.

Here’s how the company did for the period ending June 30, compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 47 cents vs. 31 cents expected

Revenue:  $10.7 billion vs. $10.57 billion expected

Revenue increased 16% from $9.23 billion a year earlier, Uber said in a press release. The company’s mobility unit reported a 23% increase in gross bookings to $20.6 billion. Gross bookings rose 16% in delivery to $18.1 billion, and were flat in the freight unit at $1.27 billion.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had said the company expected around 20% growth for the second quarter, based on anticipated continued expansion in its core mobility business, and rising frequency of orders for food and trips through its membership subscribers.

For the third quarter, Uber expects bookings of $40.25 billion to $41.75 billion. The middle of the range, $41 billion, fell shy of the $41.18 billion average estimate, according to StreetAccount. The company expects adjusted earnings of $1.58 billion to $1.68 billion, with the middle of the range just above the $1.62 billion average estimate.

Uber’s “monthly active platform consumers,” or MAPCs, reached 156 million in the second quarter with 2.77 billion trips via the Uber platform. This compares with 137 million MAPCs and 2.28 billion trips during the same period a year ago.

Uber also reported $1.02 billion in net income for the quarter, which included a $333 million pretax benefit from “revaluations of Uber’s equity investments.”

In May, the company announced a partnership with Instacart that would add a “restaurants” tab to the grocery delivery app, enabling its users to order from restaurants and have deliveries fulfilled by Uber Eats.

In July, Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD and Uber announced a partnership to bring around 100,000 EVs to Uber drivers starting in Europe and Latin America. The companies also plan “to collaborate on future BYD autonomous-capable vehicles to be deployed on the Uber platform,” Uber said Tuesday.

While BYD vehicles aren’t sold or available for lease in the U.S., Uber has a range of other incentives and options in place to motivate drivers to use Tesla and other battery-electric vehicles, rather than gas-powered cars.

Analysts on the earnings call asked Khosrowshahi about Uber’s experience with autonomous vehicles, including its partnerships and long-term strategy for the market. Uber and Waymo partner in Arizona to let Uber users book driverless rides and food deliveries as an option.

Khosrowshahi didn’t disclose specifics about Waymo, but said broadly, “AV players” experience much higher utilization with Uber than they do “without a network on a first-party basis.” He said Uber “will continue to have the most liquid and largest marketplace” and that there will be a “pretty long hybrid period as autonomous is developing and regulators are trying to figure out exactly how to regulate it.”

“We don’t think this will be a winner take all market,” Khosrowshahi said.

Uber shares were down 5% for the year as of Monday’s close, but are now up slightly after Tuesday’s rally.

340,2024-08-06,159,"Disney raises streaming prices for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+  Disney is raising prices on its streaming platforms.

Starting mid-October, most plans for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ will cost $1 to $2 more per month, according to a press release Tuesday. The most expensive plans for Hulu, which include live TV, will cost $6 more per month.

Disney+ basic and premium will be priced at $9.99 and $15.99, respectively. Hulu with ads will cost $9.99 monthly, while Hulu without adds will cost $18.99 per month. ESPN+, which features ads, will cost $11.99 per month.

The price hikes come as Disney continues to push its customers toward bundles to get a bigger bang for their buck.

For some time, Disney has offered a bundle of its own services, either Hulu and Disney+, or the two streaming services plus ESPN+. The existing bundle of Disney+ and Hulu, with ads, will also get a price hike this fall, up $1 to $10.99 per month. The same bundle without ads won’t see any price increase from it’s current rate of $19.99 per month.

Disney has also partnered with Warner Bros. Discovery to offer a bundle, which will include Disney+, Hulu and Max. In July, the companies announced the bundle would be available for $16.99 with ads, and $29.99 commercial-free, noting “a savings of 38% compared with the price of the services purchased separately.”

Disney also aims to entice subscribers with ABC News Live and a playlist featuring preschool content, available to all subscribers starting September 4, according to the release Tuesday. The company plans to introduce four more curated playlists for premium subscribers.

“Playlists are the latest example of how we’re providing the best value and experience for our subscribers every time they open Disney+,” Alisa Bowen, president of the streaming platform, said in the news release.

Disney reports its fiscal third-quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday.

25,2024-08-06,9,"Accidental Wash Sale suggest next steps I hold multiple lots of VTI purchased over various points of time. 4 of those lots were showing a loss yesterday and I decided to sell those lots (only) to offset gains from sale of other securities. Only after the sale did I realize that one of the lots was held for less than 30 days.

I am still holding a few other lots that have gains against them. I am now wondering what I should do given that I accidentally triggered wash sale, specially since I hold multiple lots. I want to stay in VTI long term, but want to minimize how long I have to deal with the consequences of the wash sale.

So what should I do now? Buy an equivalent amount immediately and track it's adjusted cost basis manually? Any consequences for the other lots of VTI that I sold or the ones I still hold?

UPDATE: Thank you to all replies! I think I panicked a bit when I read the description of what constitutes a wash sale since it has a clause about securities purchased 30 days before or 30 days after the sale event. My updated understanding, based on the replies and further research, is that so far I have NOT triggered wash sales since I have only bought in the past and have just now sold for the first time. However, if I now buy more VTI within 30 days of the loss sale, only then it would trigger wash sales.

Update 2: Vanguard's realized gain / loss report, which updated a day after the sales, confirms that I DID trigger wash sale unfortunately. It shows a message ""The loss of $X has been disallowed due to wash sale activity in this security. The disallowed amount has been added to the cost basis of shares that cause each wash sale to occur."" So I guess no further action on my part to track cost basis for these shares. I guess the takeaway is to ensure I don't try to do any TLH activity if I have any purchasing activity 30 days prior."

The most likely resolution will be that the first time you turn on your iPhone you are given a screen with the different search engines in a random list.

You then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.

Obviously this would be very bad for Apple.  Today, Apple sells the access to their customers and Google has been reported to pay Apple over $15 billion per year.  Some estimate over $20 billion.

I believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.

Then Apple would be one of the search engine options when you first turn on your iPhone and the hope would be people would choose the Apple option over the Google option.

133,2024-08-06,148,"What's the deal with German automakers being so undervalued? German car companies like Mercedes, BMW, Porsche being valued at under 50 billion with P/E of around 5 seems massively illogical. Musk paid 44 billion for Twitter. Porsche's market cap is 30 billion. You could not even buy all the Porsches that are produced in a single year for 30 billion (roundabout 300k cars times 120k average price = 36 billion) let alone come anywhere close to buying the company. 

So how does it make sense that in theory, owning 51 % of the shares, which equals only about 15 billion worth right now, makes you the owner of the Porsche company? Of course this is in theory because you cannot just go and buy 51 % of the shares but you get the point.

As reference, Intel currently is still valued 4 times as much as Porsche and twice as much as Mercedes while basically being a company on lifeline supported by tax money while Mercedes released the first approved level 3 self-driving car (ahead of Tesla) so these companies aren't just sleeping on new tech and living off of past glory like Intel to be valued only around or under the 50 billion mark.

Antitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers.

Google will face another antitrust trial September 9th, this time over ad tech. The company will face off in federal court against the US Department of Justice in Virginia, after the DOJ claimed in January 2023 that Google violated US antitrust law by illegally monopolizing the digital ads market, allegedly boosting its profits while raising costs for advertisers. Google has said the DOJ’s reasoning “would slow innovation, raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.”

However, CrowdStrike is highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that it acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed willful misconduct.""

Carlinsky said any liability by CrowdStrike is ""contractually capped at an amount in the single-digit millions… while litigation would be unfortunate, CrowdStrike will respond aggressively, if forced to do so.""Bastian recently said the impact from the IT outage would cost the airline $500 million.

As hedge funds typically fund their bets through borrowing, their adjustments are exacerbating market moves, some investors said.

Banks give hedge funds leverage, essentially a loan to fund investing, which amplifies hedge fund returns but can also increase losses.

A note sent by Goldman Sachs to clients on Friday showed that gross leverage from Goldman Sachs prime brokerage, or the total amount that hedge funds have borrowed, declined in June and July, but still sits near five-year highs.

Last week marked the third consecutive week that hedge funds' bets that stocks will fall outpaced the addition of bets that they will rise, Goldman said in a separate note, saying one long position was added for every 3.3 short bets.

It added on Monday that as of the Asian close, Japan-focused hedge funds were down 7.6% in the past three trading sessions.

While macro funds may have been involved in currency trades relating to the yen, many stock-trading hedge funds, because of a June short selling ban in South Korea and regulatory headwinds against the same practice in China, had moved focus to Japan, investors said."

6,2024-08-05,11,"How does VIX correlate to the market and what does it mean? Hey reddit, I had 2 main questions:

1. Recently the VIX hit 60+, levels only seen during during the dotcom bubble, '08 and covid. Generally the vix just shows volatility so here it means stocks can fluctuate +/-60% (I understand that's not exactly it but for simplicity sake) but historically it basically just means stocks will crash. Volatility works both ways but you would never see markets rally 10% let alone higher levels  when VIX is so high so why do people say it can mean fluctuations (implying down or UP movements) when it exclusively has only related to the down movements?


2. I saw people online saying that when the VIX was at severe lows in the 10s in 2021, that the top was in and the market was gonna crash. How is this possible because doesn't this mean less volatility which is a good thing? Less volatility = less fluctuating = better chance of simply trading sideways no? Is it because there's no volatility/movement most people will take their profits so it goes down? Because by this logic when VIX is low its a bad sign when VIX is high its a bad sign, then what the hell is it good for?

Some basic ideas I just want to say before the comments roll in, I understand the vix = volatility isn't that simple and technically it's the rolling average of options prices for the next 30 days etc etc, but in an eli5 sense sources can equate VIX to volatility with the idea that it's inversely correlated to the market and historically this simple explanation seems true.

In addition, I understand in isolation the VIX doesn't mean much, I'm not basing my entire thesis off of just this index however I'm simply trying to get a better understanding of how it operates. 

Thank you for the help and I apologize if I made any mistakes!"

QUOTES:

BRUCE KIRK, CHIEF JAPAN EQUITY STRATEGIST, GOLDMAN SACHS, TOKYO

""You can see this correction perhaps as a by-product of what has to date been a very concentrated and momentum-driven Japan rally where foreign investors have crowded into the same narrow group of liquid stocks for an extended period.

""When that reverses ... this tends to be what happens. The exporters have been hit first, and now everything else is following as risk is being flattened aggressively. It will take some time for this to play out.

JAMES SALTER, CIO AND MANAGER, ZENNOR JAPAN FUND, LONDON

""We have been warning that a stronger yen currency would initially cause indices to fall. What has been more difficult to gauge is the extent of the yen carry trade. The recent stock market losers have included banks, insurance, autos and technology companies. These are all overcrowded trades that have seen foreigner’s pile into.

""A stronger yen seems likely. This will lead to a bifurcated market where I suspect the ""winners"" of the last year bounce short-term but thereafter struggle. Many of these names are yen sensitive and exposed to the global economic cycle.

""Our portfolio, however, remains very domestically orientated. We will nibble at some existing names that have pulled back but are cognisant that the deleveraging may have further to go.""

SAISUKE SAKAI, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGIES

""From an economist point of view, U.S. and Japan economies aren't that bad now and the fall seems to be a quick correction of stock and currency markets that had been swollen by overseas investors. But this could cause a so-called ""negative wealth effect"" on Japan's household spending that could delay the consumption-led, wage growth-driven recovery scenario by crushing retail investors' confidence.""

""Younger Japanese people who just started investing this year with the introduction of New NISA (tax-free scheme) saw their Nikkei gains wiped off in the past couple of days. Younger generations are also vulnerable to the BOJ hike's mortgage impacts and may further get discouraged by the gloomier prospects shown in the stock prices.""

TRAVIS LUNDY, ANALYST, QUIDDITY ADVISORS, HONG KONG

""The fall in stock prices appears to be significantly driven by position unwinding, causing further price falls, causing cascading unwinding. Today reportedly saw lots of margin calls.

""The BOJ hiked rates on Wednesday and stocks - especially bank stocks - were up. Stocks fell on Thursday after the Ueda-san press conference moved USDJPY further but bank stocks did not fall. They were again up in USD terms. The really big move started Friday and then cascaded into Monday based on weak markets overnight and further USDJPY move.

""This appears to be a perfect storm of ""risk off"" related to Japan. Much less about the BOJ. Much more about tolerance for pain ahead of what was supposed to be a slow summer break.""

BEN BENNETT, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR ASIA, LGIM, HONG KONG

""Looks like a lot of trades that have done well in the first half of the year are unwinding, some more rapidly than others. I don't think the rate hike by the Bank of Japan or the US employment report on Friday justify such a big reaction, so I suspect we're seeing traders being stopped out of positions as volatility spikes.""

RICHARD KAYE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, COMGEST, TOKYO

""The sudden narrowing of the Japan-U.S. yield gap has provoked the partial normalization of the yen, and the mistaken foreign Hot Money flows to Banks and yen plays are being rightly sold off, which is at the centre of today's and Friday's move. Domestic demands SMIDs - GMO Payment, Fast Retailing, are significantly outperforming, and up in absolute terms in dollars for the month, ahead of major global indices.

""In short, not only the currency but the entire 'value' trade in Japan which had hijacked our market for two years is being unwound - and great news for serious investors who are most of the market participants, the silent majority eclipsed by recent hot money moves.""

KYLE RODDA, SENIOR FINANCIAL MARKET ANALYST, [CAPITAL.COM](http://CAPITAL.COM), MELBOURNE

""The markets are in meltdown and it's a sea of red across the world. The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade - investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly U.S. tech stocks.

We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses. The rapidity of the move has caught a lot of investors off guard; there's a lot of panic selling now, which is what causes these non-linear reactions in asset prices to pretty straightforward fundamental dynamics.""

87,2024-08-05,24,"Intensifying Yen Rally Sinks Japan Stocks, Rattles Global Market (Bloomberg) -- Turmoil in Japan’s financial markets intensified Monday as the yen extended its rebound against the dollar to almost 13% from July’s low and stocks headed for a bear market. Yields on benchmark Japanese government bonds tumbled by the most in two decades.

The intensity of the moves continued to take investors by surprise, hurting everyone from mom-and-pop traders of shares and currencies to large hedge funds and institutions. The slump in bond yields cast a shadow over bank earnings, triggering a record 21% intraday decline in the shares of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., the nation’s biggest lender.

The sharp appreciation of the currency, which has gathered pace since the Bank of Japan increased interest rates on July 31, is also rumbling through global markets as it upends countless investment strategies that were built on cheap borrowing in yen.

“What a complex situation to be in for Japanese policymakers — a loose monetary policy kills your currency and a slightest hint of tightening breaks your stock market,” said Charu Chanana, head of currency strategy at Saxo Markets. The yen may get 140 to the greenback sooner rather than later if concern over the risk of a US recession continues to rise, which will further weigh on Japanese stocks, she said.

All 33 of the industry groups represented in the Topix index have fallen since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates. After falling into a correction on Friday with a slump of more than 10% from its July peak, the gauge is Monday set to enter a bear market with the decline now in excess of 20%.

“Falling stock prices mean that companies’ business performances are expected to deteriorate in the future, and if the economy weakens, credit spreads may face widening pressure as well,” said Noritaka Oda, head of debt syndication at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.

The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield slid as much as 17 basis points, the most since 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The risk-off sentiment isn’t all emanating from Japan. The rally in global bonds that’s sent yields spinning lower in large part reflects worries over the US economic outlook. Concern is growing that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve with policy support and global investors are ditching risk assets and going into safe havens.

I also realize that if I buy back within 30 days, I won’t be able to claim and capital losses on my tax return. I suppose I’m fine with that too.

From the article:

[ But even if there is a design flaw, it is most likely the interconnect between two Blackwell GB100s to a GB200. This would mean that the individual Blackwell GPUs are not affected. It has already been reported here that problems with this interconnect could lead to production delays of two weeks. However, such problems are not uncommon when starting production of a new, highly complex product like the GB200, and are usually resolved in a short period of time, resulting in an improved product.

For the above reasons, I think it's unlikely that ""The Information""'s report uncovered a relevant problem at NVIDIA. No complex product has ever been rolled out at scale without at least some minor problems during development or production. ]"

Battle Creek, Michigan-based Kellanova, with a market value of about $20 billion, declined to comment to Reuters. Mars of McLean, Virginia, one of the largest closely held companies in the US, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from the news agency.

There’s no certainty that Kellanova, which makes popular snacks including Pringles and Pop-Tarts, will engage in talks or pursue a deal with Mars, the news agency reported Sunday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Another suitor may also approach Kellanova, the people told the news agency. 

Kellanova, which reported earnings last week, raised its guidance for the full year as new products and marketing drove higher sales of its brand-name snacks. 

Its products include the snack, plant-based and international cereal businesses of the former Kellogg Co. from when that company completed a spinoff last year. The US cereal business went to WK Kellogg Co.

Nvidia said it was on track to ramp up production of its most advanced artificial intelligence chip, following reports of a delay in its launch due to design flaws.

Tech journal The Information had reported that design flaws on its new Blackwell chip could cause a delay of three months or more and the setback could affect customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft, which have collectively ordered tens of billions of US dollars' worth of chips.

The chip giant's Blackwell series succeeds its earlier flagship AI chip, the Grace Hopper Superchip.

In response, a Nvidia spokesman said ""Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in the second half."""

58,2024-08-04,25,"Do you think the rotation into small caps is over at this point? Or do you think there’s still room to go? Small caps are more sensitive to macro-economics and so recession fears (whether or not an actual recession occurs) are certainly not great for small caps. Additionally if investors are fearful and not greedy, it’s likely that they’ll prefer putting their money into more defensive investments like utilities.

Then again, if the fed is trying to meet their dual mandate and keep the unemployment rate at a reasonable level, they’ll be much more likely to have more rate cuts between now and the end of the year, perhaps as many as 100 bps. This would obviously benefit small cap companies most, as they rely most heavily on loans; after all, it was the possibility of an impending ding rate cut that initiated this rotation in the first place, so a steeper rate cut would likely bode well for small caps.

The Russell 2000 etf (IWM) was trading at 201 when it skyrocketed to a peak of 224 when the rotation to small caps occurred, and has since dropped, losing almost all its gains, and closed on Friday at 209.

51,2024-08-04,41,"My thoughts on META **I'd like to start a dialogue on what investors think about META - please challenge or add onto this discussion. This is a long post, so I've posted the TLDR below.**

Given the recent negative non-farm jobs report and unemployment prints, I think the market is missing a great opportunity in META stock after a great earnings report.

Context: META pre-earnings was about $470 and post earnings is now $488. They beat earnings by 8%. META is down from its high of $540.

Position: I have sold some META puts at lower strike points, so yes I am biased and want the company to perform well, but will change my mind if there's a compelling argument otherwise.

**First thoughts on the market:**

The sell-off is a correction that gives long term investors an opportunity to buy companies at a less inflated P/E ratio. I think recession concerns are overblown given the following:

* Absolute levels of unemployment remain very low
* Meeting inflation targets are important for encouraging discretionary spending for lower income populations so that buying power won't be continuously eroded and we can move past this tightening cycle
* The Fed has the ability to reduce interest rates significantly if warranted
* Reduction in mortgage rates will allow: (1) existing homeowners to reduce interest burden and increase discretionary spending and (2) stimulate big ticket purchases (e.g. cars, homes, etc.)
* Reduced bond yields means equities become more attractive in comparison. In the short run, the carry trade has largely unwinded from its highs in July 2024 and further downside risk is less than before - [see chart here from ING](https://think.ing.com/articles/jpy-peeling-back-the-carry-trade-onion/).

**META specific thoughts:**

* **Earnings:**
   * Just crushed earnings expectations, their advertising business continues to run strong with user base growth. They stated that they have seen early benefits from their CAPEX spend on AI (not sure if it reaches desired ROI yet however).
* **Reasonable valuation in the short run:**
   * Currently trading at \~25 PE (TTM) and forward PE is \~21 to 24 depending on EPS forecasts. [Source linked here](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/meta/forecast/). For context, Meta hit its lowest PE of 14 in December 2022 when people thought Meta wouldn't exist anymore due to ad spend concerns, apple privacy updates, and issues with facebook engagement.
   * Compared to other tech companies investing in AI, Meta (along with Google) has one of the lowest P/Es with a comparable growth rate. Relative to its peers, its PEG ratio is lower as well. However, I think some of this difference is explained by its reliance on ad spend which is cyclical and less resilient in downturns.
* **Long term bets:**
   * Meta has invested in long term bets in AI and Virtual reality which have yet to pay off and are considered a cost burden.
   * For example, in their recent earnings call, they've talked about using AI stand-in personas to help influencers and small businesses answer questions to followers. If they become the ""small business or personal"" AI, then they can deepen relationships with users and monetize in ways beyond ads through reoccuring services revenue. Reoccuring revenue and proving monetization of AI will give it a boost in EPS given investors value this type of revenue more.
   * I believe Meta is trying to move away from reliance on ads and provide value to users in ways that cannot be pulled away as easily (similar to other SaaS companies)
* **Spending Risks:**
   * CAPEX is large which has a future drag on EPS, but I think they can scrap their VR initiatives if needed if cost efficiency is required.
   * If AI doesn't work out, EPS growth will be harmed in the outer years (assuming near term growth is not expected to be fueled by AI).
* **Economic Risks:**
   * Short term dependence on ad spend which is cylical and impacted during recessions
   * Chinese companies spending a lot on Meta for ads - this might go away
   * I think given interest rates are coming down - hopefully any softness will be alleviated quickly.

**TLDR:** Short term business is reasonably valued and forward valuations aren't priced for explosive AI monetization. This results in upside both from an EPS and P/E perspective if there is no prolonged economic downturn and especially if new AI products show early chutes of monetization. Would appreciate any thoughts/challenges to this from other investors."

> “You even see some analysts describing it as **a breakthrough akin to the original iPhone.”**

> “Let me be clear: At this point, Apple Intelligence isn’t that.”

> Now, it’s true that this is just the first beta release and the company will undoubtedly improve it over the next few months. But I suspect that we’re seeing a fairly good picture of what Apple Intelligence will look like when it debuts around October. 

> “I found the ability to summarize emails to be useful: It provided an excellent distillation of the message’s content. This is particularly a perk for message previews, which typically just show the first few lines of an email. But the summaries of text message conversations — particularly for fast-moving group chats — were a disappointment and mostly useless. Summaries are also helpful in Safari for articles, but I don’t foresee that being a particularly popular feature. “

> “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”

It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”

> “I was less impressed with the reply suggestions in Messages, which don’t immediately seem like a major upgrade over the existing keyboard suggestions in iOS. They could be a lot more thoughtful, perhaps by better using the context of the chat so far, rather than just the last message in the thread.”

> “The best feature is the ability to record a phone call and get a transcript of the conversation as well as a summary of what took place. In my tests, this has worked almost flawlessly, and the summaries have been excellent. It’s certainly a nice time saver.”

> “Type to Siri is also a nice upgrade, as is the new visual cue that Siri is active on the iPhone, iPad and CarPlay. But neither of those interface improvements has anything to do with AI.”

> “In any case, these are mainly niceties, not necessities.”

> “There is nothing so compelling yet that would make an iPhone 14 Pro user upgrade to an iPhone 16 just for Apple Intelligence.”

> “Some key Apple Intelligence features aren’t in the initial beta. [Such as AI PHOTO APP and OS-INTEGRATED CHATGPT.] These latter capabilities will likely come in November or December. 

> “Users will have to wait until 2025 to see the fully revamped Siri.”

> “But even when [these delayed features of] Apple Intelligence [are] available, the company will still be playing catch-up. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is miles ahead of Apple in applying AI to photos.”

> “Apple’s effort still **feels like a response** to the AI revolution being advanced by Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft Corp.”

11,2024-08-04,32,"The Merits of Combining Fundamental and Technical Analysis. Below I describe my approach to investing with a hybrid blend of Fundamental and Technical Analysis. Then I go on to describe my reasoning for this approach. I’d love to hear what you all think and how you all approach investing/trading. 

**Method to My Madness: Birds Eye View**

**1. Market Research**  
Find an industry that is poised to grow. It’s preferable if it features the hopes and dreams of institutional investors, industry insiders, and avid consumers alike. Learn everything about that industry to the point you could work in or start a business in that industry.

**2. Find A Dream Team**  
Identify the greatest companies of that industry. They should be market leaders as well as masters at capital management. They need to exude an aura that fosters the support of the dreamers. Put all these companies on a watchlist.

**3. Leave No Stone Unturned**  
Grab your watchlist and consistently apply fundamental macro/microeconomic analysis to those companies. This should have a focus on both quantitative and qualitative attributes. Be sure to analyze businesses they interact with and the governments that regulate them.

**4. Find A Good Price**  
Gather all the companies that are fair valued and undervalued and mark them for technical analysis. This valuation usually applies to growth (like DCF) but other methods can work here. Be patient with your overvalued companies.

**5. Plot Your Course**  
Apply Elliot Wave analysis to the charts of the companies on the TA list. Select a few projected price points based on the typical wave lengths that commonly occur in the current wave pattern you believe you are in. Consider the current economic trends, market structure (support and resistance), market sentiment, and game theory, and apply Bayesian probability to determine the likelihood of the price action trending towards those points. This approach turns the potential price movement from a guess into a multiple-choice question.

**6. Balance Reward and Risk**  
Determine a stop loss that matches the current and projected volatility. Use your stop loss and projected price appreciation to calculate your Reward to Risk Ratio. Compare this to your win rate to see if this trade would be profitable over repetitive instances. All the trades that are profitable mark for buy, be patient with the rest.

**7. Look Before You Leap**  
Gather all the probable/profitable trade setups and use Stage Analysis to enter your position **after** the trend begins.

**8. Be Vigilant**  
Monitor your live trades and the company’s economic conditions. Continue evaluating your other candidates to find another one that’s in play. Be aware of and manage your emotions in a responsible way. It’s not a good idea to trade when you’re not at your best. Let your emotions alert you and your logic and reasoning guide you. Do your best to avoid cognitive bias.

**9. Find A Clear Exit**  
Once stage analysis shows you’ve entered consolidation exit your trade. If the trend continues you can enter the trade again but only if the company is still fair valued or undervalued, and if the Reward to Risk Ratio points to a profit when considering your win rate.

**10. Rinse and repeat**  
Debrief and analyze your trades to see where you excelled and where you lost your way. Find ways to identify improvements on your workflow and techniques. Eventually you’ll find what your niche is. When you do, embrace it, but always continue learning to expand your circle of competence.

**Disclaimer:**  
I am not a financial adviser. I cannot determine your risk tolerance. This strategy has significant risk. Please do your own research. Always paper trade and consult a financial advisor before attempting to use a strategy for investing/trading. Good luck out there!


**Advocating for a Hybrid Approach of Fundamental and Technical Analysis**

This is written from the point of view of a smaller portfolio (position size can enter and exit in less than one trading day).

If you got this far without flipping to the next post then I invite you to read my reasoning behind the approach. I made separate paragraphs to appeal to both sides of the spectrum. I could probably go into a lot more detail but brevity is priceless if it still gets the point across. If it doesn’t fully get across or if it leaves you with more questions I’ll be happy to engage in productive dialogue. 

**To my fellow traders**, integrating fundamental value into my trades allows me to be anticipatory rather than purely reactionary. By understanding upcoming changes in earnings growth and capital management, I can identify promising trade setups with greater conviction and confidence in the market's movements. This enables me to set stop losses that accommodate volatility and let my winners ride, leading to larger reward-to-risk ratios and higher win rates. The combination of high reward-to-risk ratios and high win rates translates to increased profits and reduced anxiety. This strategy also frees me from constantly monitoring screens and charts, allowing me to live my life while still dedicating focused time to research and charting. A significant amount of my market research comes from everyday life experiences (qualitative fundamentals), providing valuable insights into both business-to-consumer and business-to-business dynamics.

**To my fellow investors**, my nimble portfolio size allows me to plot my course and look before I leap, adopting a humble and sustainable approach. John Maynard Keynes famously said, ""The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."" Waiting for signs that other market participants are starting to agree with me helps avoid being too early or wrong. Unlike those with vast capital who can move the market or sit on losses for years before profiting, I consider opportunity costs seriously. I cut my losses and let my winners ride. Using fundamentals and waiting for confirmation minimizes losses and maximizes gains.

While this strategy may not be groundbreaking, similar approaches have been advocated by investment giants like William J. O'Neil. This hybrid approach offers the best of both worlds: capturing 80% of the upward move while avoiding 80% of the losses. This has led to great returns even during bear markets, as I move on to the next trade setup rather than waiting out corrections. My next step is to develop a long-short strategy, shorting (buying puts in the beginning) only the most predictable companies, to further refine my approach.

Incorporating both fundamental and technical analysis provides a comprehensive strategy that benefits from diversified signals, offering a robust framework for navigating the complexities of the market. The way I see it is this: if you wanted to build a house, would you rely solely on a hammer? Or would you prefer a plethora of tools, each designed to tackle specific tasks with the utmost efficiency and precision?

As for the ensuing discussion I’m not trying to prove something or claim my strategy is the best. I’m expressing what’s worked for me over the last handful of years. Some may ask why I’m giving out my strategy I worked so hard to build for free, well it is merely a Birds Eye view (you’ll still have to research each tactic I mentioned), I didn’t invent any thing (aside from some fundamental analysis techniques that I didn’t mention), my creative input here is piecing together other inventions in a unique way to make a system of systems. Also the stock market isn’t a zero sum game and I make money from investing, trading and working so I don’t really need to. I think paying it forward and creating community discussion would generate way more value for the world than trying to promote another paid book, course, or video amongst the sea of others. I suppose in this instance I’m supporting open source. I respect fundamental, technical, or hybrid analysis biases. I welcome constructive criticism and additional contributions of valuable insight. Or even comment your own strategy (hybrid or not). But this is Reddit so everyone gets to say whatever they want lol. Have at it!"

""As we've stated before, Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in the second half,"" an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement in response to the report.

Microsoft said it had nothing to add, while Meta and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Nvidia informed Microsoft and another major cloud service provider this week of a delay in the production of its most advanced AI chip in the Blackwell series, the Information said, citing a Microsoft employee and another person with knowledge of the matter."

1) The fed saw it and still held rates steady

2) The fed didn’t see it and made a decision without all the most recent information.

Would the fed really not be able to get a preview of the jobs report when it comes out within a day of a fed meeting?

Maybe they don’t. I don’t know, but it would seem strange that they wouldn’t have the ability to get some kind of preview."

The fear and greed index is meant to interpret investor sentiment. In recent memory the index has only dropped this low once. In October 2023 the fear index flashed a 21. Which is classified as extreme fear. The Dow dropped about 5% and had a minor pullback. Similar to what we are seeing now. In the following 10 months the Dow rallied 20%. The market has to pullback a healthy amount of times to prevent extreme greed levels.

4,2024-08-03,4,"ABBNY good buy? I know that ABB is a pretty big electronics company, notably in EV charging and electric grid infrastructure. 

EV Charging: As electric vehicle sales continue to grow exponentially and more and more automakers are rolling out EVs and phasing out internal combustion, charging infrastructure is going to go under huge demand to keep up with the switch over to EVs. 

Grid infrastructure: demand for electric power has been growing very quickly, thanks to the AI boom and electric vehicles rolling out. Additionally with more renewable energy being added, the supply of power is less constant. Because of this, it’s possible that the electric grid will need to go under a lot of changes to be able to handle the more erratic changes in the supply/demand curve of electricity."

12,2024-08-03,16,"Negative sentiment around the car industry The car industry is a notoriously difficult one to invest in. Highly cyclical, very competitive, and very very capital intensive. Right now consumer sentiment seems at the lowest point in the decade.

Everytime I lookat a new car model, people complain that the company has lost its way, their new cars sucks, are too expemsive and people brag about their 15 years old car with 200 miles on it.

I am not a car enthusiast but I understand that higher prices and interest rates take a toll on people. But I think at the end they will have to comply with the new industry standards, and the brands still a bit od differentiation allowing companies to charge some margins (car aren't a commodity yet).

This is good news for many legacy cars companies. People have to change cars at some point and the competition isn't doing great either. Even if there is a risk of a price war, I think it's not too great, and many company will retain their margins in the long run. I am sitting on the sidelines for now, but if prices keep falling I might start building a position.

Some may consider EVs as the Levant in the room. But at least with Tesla, EV sales are struggling as much as ICE ones or more. As for China, I think tarrifs will do a great job at hurting consumers and protecting western automakers.

Do you think the industry will recover from this downturn and go back to 2021/2022 level of profitability or do is it going to experience a prolonged crisis?"

0,2024-08-03,2,"Uranium: Too Late to the Party or Fashionably Late It wasn't very long after subscribing to a single newsletter (which bundled newsletters) and later re-entering trading actively that I encountered a flurry of very persuasive arguments for nuclear energy in general constituting an energy revolution.

In the past few days I've traded like I never traded before (true) to get in on it with all the hype building in my head. During that time I noticed nuclear energy already seems to have started that year on year after year on year climb after bottoming out years back already. I went further back on a number of stocks and found many of them were already approaching historical peaks optimal to sell at for well timed investments rather than troughs optimal to buy at for well timed investors.

Different particular nuclear energy and/or uranium stocks appear to be exceptional here, which I think can be typified in more ways than one.

It feels a lot less like getting the chance of several lifetimes and more like I don’t even have a firm grasp on the basics and I’ve already gotten roped into a hype train that, although probably more reasonable than holding for meme stocks, very well might have good reason to not believe in them. Especially when they’re already so high up.

Another thing I've noticed is that the behavior of particular nuclear stocks appear to move in 'clusters', clusters which have since come to counteract one another in the recent spikes for some concurrent with dramatic falls and even collapses for others. And then there's the ones that hardly moved in their trajectory whatsoever. The latter I've only seen either improving ever so slightly but consistently or stagnating entirely.

I'm assuming this is strongly correlated with very real differences in the best forecasts for each cluster? If not that, my only hypothesis is a whole lot of overselling devaluing very promising stocks and maneuvering around to similar nuclear stocks perceived as even more promising (and maybe some panic selling), **potentially** to the point where some stocks are selling at a discount now or highly undervalued.

I think I could use some sense being slapped into me."
5,2024-08-03,14,"Thoughts on Affirm Hey y'all! I've been building a position in affirm for a couple months now buying on dips and averaging up/down whenever I can. I have a position of 550 shares now and am planning on holding for 5-10 years. I'm not sure if I will buy any more at this time, since I have about all I want for the time being. 

Many people seem to be torn on the BNPL narrative. I have read many people who scrutinize the business model itself, and the regulation that may have to come along with its maturity. I also understand that a BNPL company is only as valuable as its algorithm for picking reliable loans. 

Does anybody have any thoughts on Affirm? Or it's competition for that matter? I, for one, am bullish mainly due to their strength in a high rate environment. I've been building this position in anticipation of rate cuts. I don't necessarily believe that the US will enter a recession, but the market may revisit a technical recession. We did just fly high for a while, and it may seem scary, but I plan on weathering that storm regardless as it's the decision I made while purchasing this stock. 

I also believe that the company, while obviously still unprofitable, is extremely undervalued. At $8b market cap, this seems to me like a company that is neglected or forgotten about in the mid cap area. The CEO seems to be all around solid and very forward looking, it seems to me they have a solid mission and he plans to execute on this plan over years and don't give much credence to quarterly goal posts. That can be good or bad, depending on ones timeframe, I do recognize. 

I am relatively familiar with the financials. The company seems to have it's market cap in total assets. It's GMV is also growing at a rapid rate. i
When rates should fall, I can only see this being a catalyst for further growth. 

Any thoughts are always welcome, feel free to discuss and share information since I am not all knowing and love to hear other perspectives. 

I also have a 40 share position in Spotify, and I trade options in conjunction with my stock portfolio. These are my only 2 long stocks, and I currently have a few cash secured puts sold on affirm. I chose these two stocks because I feel they can weather a technical or real recession. Although Spotify is a bit of a higher flyer having almost quadrupled from the bottom to where I have made my position.

0,2024-08-02,66,"You guys need to realize something about Intel... # INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is.

*What do I mean by this?*

Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing.

Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet.

This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert.

*What exactly is Intel's bet?*

**The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share**

**Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both.**

Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. **The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets.**

With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one.

*What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets?*

Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years.

Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler.

TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies.

*Should I become a bagholder?*

Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it.

**Going long in Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here. Very very risky, high chance of failure.**"

Looking at the last q as an example, CROX reported $1,112M in revenue and $326 in operating income. They have decided to stop reporting operating margin by segment because they don't want to make HD look even worse than it obviously is.

On a segment basis: Crocs contributed $914M. While we don't know for sure, based on previous earnings report, we can assume a 35-37% EBIT margin, so let's call it 35% on the low end which means it contributed $319M to EBIT.

HD contributed $198M in revenue, and if we're lucky, contributed $7M to EBIT (3% margin). If we're unlucky and Crocs had a 37% EBIT, it contributed -12M to EBIT (-6% margin).

Let's break it down by segments and use a sum of parts analysis. Crocs is expected to grow 7-9% on the top line, and we will assume they maintain a 35% EBIT margin (which is bonkers btw). That brings the FY24 revenue to be around $3.27B and $1.14B in EBIT. This is quite frankly conservative as their most recent Q has shown Crocs is killing it internationally.

HD on the other hand is expected to contract -10% - 8% for the FY24 giving us revenue of $850M. Given that we already calculated an EBIT margin of 3%, this gives us an EBIT of $25M. I'm going to be pessimistic and say this is 0 as I hate this segment.

Using a very conservative 10x PE multiple, less the 1.7B debt CROX acquired from purchasing HD, that would give us an EV of 9.7B, or $153/share, representing 25% upside. Again, this is for a business that has consistent single digit growth with unbelievable margins, rivaling software companies. 

The CEO is refusing to give up on HD, and pouring money to attempt to build it up but the results are just not showing. The market is clearly telling CROX they don't want HeyDude and Andrew Rees, the CEO who I very much respect but am very frustrated with, gave a bullshit answer in response to why they were showing no growth despite the increase in SG&A

>Jonathan Komp


>Hi, thank you. Just one more follow-up, but I wanted to ask a bigger picture question around the philosophy for the SG&A investments. And, obviously, this year is a year in which you are planning to grow revenue 3% to 5%. And yet, you are spending almost 20% higher SG&A for the year. So, could you just maybe remind us your overall philosophy? And as we lookout, is there hope that these investments drive faster revenue growth, and any color there in terms of the overall strategy? Thanks.


>Andrew Rees


>Great question, Jon. So, obviously, we are starting off -- I would say we are starting off from a base of extremely high profitability, right? So, even this year with that distorted investment profile that you just highlighted in your question, we'll achieve kind of 25.5% in terms of EBITD margin, extraordinary level relative to our peers in the industry which we are in, and obviously, that's due to the very high gross margins we experienced on our Crocs brand and also the efficiency of our business model. In terms of philosophy going forward, I think there will be periods of time when we choose to invest in SG&A. Both variable and SG&A because of our marketing is variable and can be turned on and off at any point in time.
And where we will make investments in talent and people and infrastructure and capabilities that we think would be important for the future. The intent of those investments is to support and -- sorry, support and guarantee -- you know guarantees don't work. But, assure long-term growth. So, we are trying to build in a company and a brand that has long-term growth potential and can continue to grow for many years to come. So, I would say there will be periods of time when we distort an SG&A. There were periods of time when we leverage SG&A. And, that's kind of how we think about it from a long-term philosophy perspective.


The market is clearly placing a negative premium on HD, to the tune of -2B. Does it make sense to invest in a company like this, where the CEO is stubborn and refusing to cut off a rotting limb?"
435,2024-08-02,106,"Intel heads for worst day on Wall Street in 50 years, falls to lowest in over a decade  Intel shares plunged the most in 50 years on Friday, reaching a price not seen since 2013, after the chipmaker reported a big earnings miss and announced a massive restructuring.

The stock plummeted 27% to $21.22 as of late morning trading. It would be the second worst day ever for the shares, behind only a 31% drop in July 1974, which was three years after Intel’s IPO. The company’s market cap is now below $100 billion.

The dramatic selloff contributed to a 2.4% drop in the Nasdaq and pulled down global semiconductor stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — known as TSMC — closed 4.6% lower in Taiwan, and Samsung was down more than 4% at the end of the session in South Korea. TSMC is the world’s biggest manufacturer of chips, while Samsung is the largest memory semiconductor firm globally.

Intel’s numbers were bad across the board.

The company swung to a $1.61 billion net loss after reporting net income of $1.48 billion in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share of 2 cents fell way short of the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, according to LSEG. Revenue also missed expectations.

Intel said it won’t pay its dividend in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 and lowered its forecast for full-year capital expenditures by over 20%. The company said it would lay off more than 15% of its employees as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

“This is the most substantial restructuring of Intel since the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in an interview that aired on Friday. “We have laid out an audacious journey of rebuilding this company, and we’re going to get that done.”

A decision to more rapidly produce Core Ultra PC chips that can handle artificial intelligence workloads contributed to the loss, Gelsinger said on a conference call with analysts. The company said pricing was more competitive than planned during the quarter, as AMD, Qualcomm and other companies have been working to take market share from Intel, which has fallen way behind its rivals in the AI battle.

The job cuts will mainly take place this year, Gelsinger wrote in a memo. It’s the largest of any single job cut listed on Layoffs.fyi, an industry tracker that’s been operating since March 2020.

Competing on merit

Adding pressure to the chip sector is a report from The Information that AI chipmaker Nvidia is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation.

The DOJ is looking at complaints that the company allegedly abused its market dominance in AI, The Information reported.

In response, a spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company “wins on merit.”

“We compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making NVIDIA openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added that Nvidia is “happy to provide any information regulators need.”

CNBC has also reached out to the DOJ on the report.

Samsung rival SK Hynix, which supplies U.S. giant Nvidia, also fell sharply to close more than 10% lower. The sell-off continued in Europe. Shares of ASML, which sells key tools required to make cutting-edge chips, declined along with STMicroelectronics and Infineon.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which includes major names in the sector, fell more than 4% on Friday after plummeting 6.5% a day earlier.

363,2024-08-02,49,"Berkshire sells $3.8 billion worth of Bank of America in 12-day selling spree  Warren Buffett is not done selling Bank of America.

Berkshire Hathaway shed a total of 19.2 million BofA shares on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday for almost $779 million at an average selling price of $40.52 per share, according to a new regulatory filing.

The conglomerate has now been offloading the bank stock for 12 consecutive days with total sales now exceeding $3.8 billion. Its remaining 942.4 million shares have a market value of $37.2 billion at Thursday’s close of $39.50.

As of Thursday’s close, Bank of America fell to the No.3 spot on Berkshire’s list of top holdings, trailing behind Apple and American Express, which is currently valued at $37.7 billion. Before the selling spree, BofA had long been Berkshire’s second biggest holding.

Berkshire remains the bank’s largest shareholder with a 12.1% stake.

The bank stock has dropped 5.2% so far this week, going as low as $38.98 in Thursday’s trading as recession fears plague the financial sector. Year to date, BofA is up more than 17%, outperforming the S&P 500.

Buffett famously bought $5 billion worth of BofA’s preferred stock and warrants in 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis, shoring up confidence in the embattled lender struggling with losses tied to subprime mortgages. He converted those warrants in 2017, making Berkshire the largest shareholder in BofA, vowing that it would be a “long, long time” before he would sell.

The legendary investor said then that he liked the business, valuation and management of the Charlotte-based bank “very much.”

BofA, under the leadership of Brian Moynihan since 2010, recently reported blowout results for the second quarter that showed rising investment banking and asset management fees as well as a positive outlook on net interest income.

Shares of the company fell around 3.6% in premarket trading on Friday.

DOJ investigators are looking at whether Nvidia pressured cloud providers to buy multiple products, the report said, citing people involved in the discussions.

The investigation is also looking into whether Nvidia charges its customers more for networking gear if they want to buy AI chips from rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Intel (INTC.O), it added.

Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the AI chip market.

The company did not comment on the report, but said that it would provide any information that regulators require.

""We compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making Nvidia openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,"" a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

The DOJ did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment late Thursday.

The report said that investigators have reached out to several of Nvidia's competitors to gather more details.

U.S. progressive groups and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren have pressed the DOJ to investigate Nvidia over competition concerns.

The groups, which oppose monopolies and promote government oversight of tech companies, among other issues, took aim at Nvidia's bundling of software and hardware, a practice that French antitrust enforcers have also flagged as they prepare to bring their own charges.

Japanese stocks plunged Friday as global markets were rattled by worries about the US economy and as traders braced for further interest rate hikes from the Bank of Japan.

The Nikkei 225 ended 5.8% lower, the index’s biggest daily drop since March 2020. It extended a global stock rout that began following the release of weak US economic data. The Japanese benchmark had already lost 2.5% Thursday and has now closed at its lowest level since January.

European markets also opened lower Friday. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 1.4%. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 were down 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. London’s bank-heavy FTSE 100 was 0.4% lower. US futures were indicating another weak open for Wall Street, with S&P 500 future down 0.9%.

On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised interest rates by 15 basis points to 0.25% in its second hike this year and announced plans to taper its bond buying. Traders expect more rate hikes to come later this year as the central bank tries to contain inflation.

“The BOJ made a hawkish shift after its surprising 15 (basis point) rate hike,” said Ken Cheung, director of foreign exchange strategy at Mizuho Securities. “Importantly, the BOJ flagged the inflation upside risks … and left the door open for further rate hikes. ”

The hike has narrowed the difference in interest rates between the United States and Japan, which pushed the Japanese yen higher against the greenback. The dollar has fallen by more than 4% against the Japanese currency since the middle of last month.

On Friday, it weakened further against the yen, down 0.3% to 148.9.

“The risk of rising yen volatility threatens the decade-long bull market of Japanese equities,” Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale, said in a research note on Thursday. He added that a rapid appreciation of the currency would hit profits at the country’s exporters.

The yen has broadly weakened over the past four years. It was down 40% against the US dollar and down 30% against the euro during that period.

Combined with strong corporate earnings and effective corporate governance reforms, the weak yen propelled the Nikkei 225 to all-time highs this year.

But as the yen strengthened over the past three weeks, Japanese equities have corrected. The Nikkei is down 12% since July 12.

“From a Japanese equity perspective, the earnings boost from a weak yen is set to diminish,” Citi analysts said on Thursday. But they remained positive about Japanese stocks in the long run, as inflation is gaining traction and a positive “wage-price spiral” is strengthening in the economy.

The hope is that rising wages and prices can help the country shake off years of economic weakness.

Elsewhere in Asia, markets tumbled across the board on Friday. South Korea’s Kospi declined 3.7%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 2.1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also lost 2.1%, and China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.9%."

Here’s how Nintendo did in its fiscal first quarter ended June 30. versus LSEG estimates:

Revenue:  246.6 billion Japanese yen ($1.65 billion) versus 289.61 billion yen expected.

Net profit:  80.9 billion Japanese yen versus 70.73 billion yen expected.

Net sales lost 46.5% year-on-year, while net profit fell 55.3%.

Nintendo sold 2.1 million units of its flagship Switch consoles, down 46% on the year.

Investors are looking out for news surrounding a successor to the Nintendo Switch console to reinvigorate its gaming business. The company previously said that the next-in-line device will be announced in the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2025.

Nintendo also previously said that it expects to sell 13.5 million units of the existing Switch console model in this period. The company stuck to that forecast on Friday.

The Switch is now more than seven years old and is the company’s second-most successful console by unit sales, after the Nintendo DS. Throughout its lifetime, Nintendo has revamped the Switch with a better display and ridden the wave of popularity of games featuring well-known characters like Mario and Zelda, which helped sustain sales in the long term.

That effect appears to have faded. Nintendo did not release any blockbuster games in the June quarter, while the company’s software sales fell 41% year-on-year to 30.64 million units.

The Japanese gaming giant has announced a string of games due out in the coming months, featuring well-known characters like Mario and Donkey Kong.

In the face of slowing console sales, Nintendo has also been trying to license out its intellectual property for use everywhere from movies to theme parks. The company is working on an animated Super Mario movie, which will be produced by Illumination and is scheduled for release in 2026. Nintendo hopes this will continue to attract users to its video games.

Despite this push, sales from the mobile and intellectual property-related part of the business fell 54% year-on-year to 14.7 billion yen.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

15,2024-08-02,25,"Apple upwards potential? The last month apples stock has gone up by almost thirty percent over something that hasn’t even been out yet. Something which sounds like a lot of hope and expensive air. I am however still very bullish on this stock and came here to hear peoples opinions so that my theory can be flamed and tested. 

Apples userbase is very big and brand loyal, they don’t run as big expenses on AI compared to their revenue and are the only company making both the hardware and software for the masses. The numbers of the second quarter released by apple were beating expectations showing that Apple is proffitable and has their loyal consumerbase which gives the company time to actualy make something out of their AI integration without rushing random functions out. Eventhough real tech people might not be a fan of having to wait most normal people will want a smooth experience which is well integrated even if it takes longer, their userbase likes the walled garden and will not change companies quickly. The big providers have said they see that people are waiting for the iphone sixteen and I think that it will be something people get exited about it doesn’t have to be the best new ai ever for most people the bitmoji and recorded calls will be what they will use most and will be envious about. Just like with the Blue and Green bubble in messages I think these features will become a must have for many. All in all I think Apple is very well placed to actualy make something out of this Ai integration. If this supercycle happens it will short to medium term boost the stock and I think and ofcourse as a shareholder hope this will happen. "

Shares of DoorDash ppopped 13% in extended trading on Thursday after the company reported second-quarter results that beat analysts’ expectations for revenue.

Here is how the company did, according to LSEG analysts’ expectations:

Loss per share: 38 cents, which may not compare to the expected loss of 9 cents

Revenue: $2.63 billion vs. $2.54 billion expected


DoorDash’s revenue increased 23% from $2.13 billion a year earlier. It narrowed its net loss to $157 million, or a loss of 38 cents per share, from $170 million, or a loss of 44 cents per share, during the same period last year.

The delivery service company said it received 635 million total orders in the quarter, up 19% year over year. DoorDash said its Marketplace GOV, which it defines as the total value of orders, was $19.71 billion, marking an increase of 20% from the year prior.

For its third quarter, DoorDash said it expects to report Marketplace GOV between $19.4 billion and $19.8 billion. Analysts were expecting $19.51 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.

“We are very pleased with our financial performance in Q2 2024, as it reflects years of investment and product-level focus that drove strong growth and improved unit economics in several major areas of our business,” the company wrote in a release Thursday."

“We had a strong second quarter, crossing $1.6 billion in annualized revenue and growing 30% year-over-year. The world is still complicated, but our team remained focused on execution and delivered terrific results, including a double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder & CEO of Cloudflare.
Founded by two grad students of Harvard Business School, Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) is a software as a service platform that helps improve security, reliability and loading times of internet applications and websites.

This quarter, Cloudflare's quarterly revenue was once again up a very solid 30% year on year. On top of that, its revenue increased $22.39 million quarter on quarter, a very strong improvement from the $16.13 million increase in Q1 CY2024. This is a sign of acceleration of growth and great to see.

Next quarter's guidance suggests that Cloudflare is expecting revenue to grow 26.2% year on year to $423.5 million, slowing down from the 32.2% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 25.6% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement.

Gross Margin & Pricing PowerWhat makes the software-as-a-service model so attractive is that once the software is developed, it usually doesn't cost much to provide it as an ongoing service.

These costs include servers, licenses, and certain personnel, and leverage on them can decide the winners in competitive markets because they determine how much can be invested into new products, sales, and talent.

485,2024-08-01,99,"Apple sales rise 5%, topping estimates as iPad and Services revenue jump Apple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue rising 5%.  

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended June 29: 

EPS: $1.40 vs. $1.35 estimated
 
Revenue: $85.78 billion vs. $84.53 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $39.30 billion vs. $38.81 billion estimated

Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $8.10 billion vs. $7.79 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $24.21 billion vs. $24.01 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.3% vs. 46.1% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  

Apple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  

Apple’s most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the company’s total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  

“On a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that’s sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach.  

Cook said that while Apple doesn’t know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  

“What we’ve done is we’ve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,” Cook said. “From a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners’ financials, and we would be paying expense.” 

“Certainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we’re spending for AI and Apple intelligence,” Cook continued.  

Apple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. 

Cook said that about half of iPad buyers haven’t owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. 

Apple’s Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  

Apple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under “Wearables, Home, and Accessories.” Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  

“A whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we’re still growing that base significantly,” Cook said.  

The Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company’s content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple’s forecast and LSEG estimates. 

Apple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple’s active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  

Apple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple’s App Store.  

However, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  

“Mainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,” Cook said. “Kantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.” 

Apple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.

1623,2024-08-01,595,"Intel to cut 15% of headcount, reports quarterly guidance miss  Intel shares slid 10% in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker said Thursday it would lay off over 15% of its employees as part of a $10 billion cost reduction plan and reported lighter results than analysts had envisioned. Intel also said it would not pay its dividend in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Here’s how the company did, compared to LSEG analyst expectations:

Earnings per share: 2 cents adjusted vs. 10 cents expected
Revenue: $12.83 billion vs. $12.94 billion expected
Intel’s revenue declined 1% year over year in the quarter, which ended on June 29, according to a statement. The company had a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, compared with net income of $1.47 billion, or 35 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

The company’s Client Computing Group that makes PC chips contributed $7.41 billion in revenue, up 9% and right around the $7.42 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Intel’s Data Center and Artificial Intelligence unit posted $3.05 billion in revenue. The result was down 3% and lower than the $3.14 billion StreetAccount consensus.

For the fiscal third quarter, Intel called for an adjusted net loss of 3 cents per share on $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in revenue. The LSEG consensus was adjusted net earnings of 31 cents per share and $14.35 billion in revenue.

During the quarter, Intel announced that Apollo would invest $11 billion in a joint venture around a chip manufacturing plant in Ireland. The company also introduced Xeon 6 server processors, along with a Gaudi 3 accelerator for artificial intelligence workloads.

In addition, Intel disclosed in May that the U.S. Commerce Department was revoking export licenses for consumer items to a customer in China, widely believed to be Huawei. Intel said second-quarter revenue would still be in its previously announced range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion, but below the middle of the range.

Excluding the after-hours move, Intel stock has lost 42% of its value so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up almost 14% in the same period.

19,2024-08-01,23,"Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?"

Maybe even reinvestment options to estimate total value at some point a year later (ex if I am reinvesting dividends). 

Anyway, the point is that I do my trades on the computer and don't log into my broker account everyday. I would like to setup an app to show me when limits are hit so I could either buy more or sell. 

For example: I buy stock A at $10. I set a limit on it to send me a reminder to sell at $20 and/or rebuy if it dips to $5. 

My current broker offers GTC and 60 day orders, but that doesn't do what I am looking for. I would like to have a reminder to go ""re-evaluate the stock"", when certain things are hit and then decide to either buy/sell.

285,2024-08-01,91,"Wayfair shares sink as CEO likens home goods slowdown to 2008 financial crisis  Online home goods company Wayfair saw sales decline in its fiscal second quarter as its CEO likened the current slowdown in the home goods category to the 2008 financial crisis.

“Our credit card data suggests that the category correction now mirrors the magnitude of the peak to trough decline the home furnishing space experienced during the great financial crisis,” Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah said in a news release. “Customers remain cautious in their spending on the home.”

The e-tailer fell short of Wall Street’s expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Shares fell 10% in premarket trading Thursday.

Here’s how Wayfair did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 47 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected

Revenue: $3.12 billion vs. $3.18 billion expected

The company reported a loss of $42 million, or 34 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended June 30. That’s slightly better than the loss of $46 million, or 41 cents per share, that it posted during the same quarter a year earlier. 

Sales dropped to $3.12 billion, down about 2% from $3.17 billion a year earlier. The slowdown in sales came even as average order values rose in the quarter from $313 to $307 and after the company opened its first large format store.

For more than a year, home goods companies like Wayfair have seen sluggish demand for things like new couches and dining sets as the overall housing market turned stagnant against high interest rates. Consumers are buying fewer new homes, which means they have fewer reasons to buy new furniture. Plus, with stubborn inflation, they’ve been more choosy on where they’re spending their discretionary income, and with options like restaurants, new clothes and trips, home goods have not been a priority. 

Wayfair has needed to entice customers with discounts to bring them in and doesn’t expect to see a resurgence in the category until interest rates are cut and the housing market bounces back. 

“We see declines that are similar to the declines that we saw in that 2008 to 2010 period and I think what that speaks to is that the category has been going through just a massive correction, a correction that we’ve previously only seen during a GDP recession,” Wayfair finance chief Kate Gulliver told CNBC in an interview. 

“Obviously we’re not technically in a GDP recession as a country right now, and so this is somewhat a unique thing to this category… we’ve seen that kind of recession-like correction in the category over the last few years.” 

Reprieve could soon be on the way after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said interest rate cuts could come as soon as September as long as economic data continues on its current path.

Wayfair, which has implemented a string of mass layoffs to get its cost structure in line with the current size of its business, has struggled to reach profitability, but the quarter was the best for free cash flow generation and adjusted EBITDA in three years, Shah said. 

The company saw adjusted EBITDA of $163 million during the quarter, still below the $168 million that Wall Street had expected, according to StreetAccount. 

“We are running the business with the goal of demonstrating substantial growth in profitability this year, even as the top line remains challenging. And that will be our mindset every year going forward as well,” said Shah.

2,2024-08-01,1,"Barclays profit dips in second quarter, beats estimates  Barclays on Thursday reported second-quarter net profit attributable to shareholders of £1.2 billion ($1.54 billion), slightly lower than a year ago, as the lender’s net interest income in its core U.K. units fell.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected attributable net profit of £1.03 billion for the period, according to LSEG data, in a decline from the £1.3 billion logged in the second quarter of 2023.

Shares were 2% higher at 8:09 a.m. London time.

Barclays posted revenue of £6.3 billion for the latest quarter, above a forecast of £6.25 billion. It also announced a share buyback program of up to £750 million.

Net interest income at Barclays’ consumer bank dropped 4% year-on-year to £3.15 billion across the January-June period, as its net interest margin declined from 3.2% to 3.15%. Income at the Barclays corporate bank fell 6%, as lower liquidity pool income offset the higher interest rate environment.

Performance was stronger at its investment bank, where income jumped 10% to £3.02 billion in the second quarter.

Max Georgiou, analyst at research firm Third Bridge, said that the Barclays investment banking revenue had outperformed expectations, providing a positive for the bank’s mid-term targets.

“To continue executing this strategy we expect to see a continued focus on regrowing share in the U.S. market,” Georgiou said.

On Thursday, Barclays also raised its full-year net interest income target for the group — excluding the head office and investment bank divisions — to circa £11 billion, from £10.7 billion previously.

Other highlights from the results included:

Credit impairment charges were steady year-on-year in the second quarter at £400 million.
Common equity tier one (CET1) capital ratio, a measure of bank’s financial strength, was 13.6%, down from 13.8% in December 2023.
Restructure underway

The British lender this year kicked off a major restructure aiming to improve efficiencies and boost profits, driving its share price 52% higher in the year to date.

Launching that program resulted in a net loss of £111 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, but the bank returned to profit in the first quarter despite a decline in year-on-year revenue.

Group Chief Executive C. S. Venkatakrishnan said Thursday the three-year plan was making “good progress,” with return on tangible equity of 11.1% across January-June meeting its target of above 10% for the year.

“We completed the sale of the performing Italian mortgage book, announced the sale of the German consumer finance business, and are on track to complete the acquisition of Tesco Bank in November 2024,” Venkatakrishnan said.

The lender’s restructure split the corporate and investment bank across Barclays U.K., Barclays U.K. Corporate Bank, Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, Barclays Investment Bank and Barclays U.S. Consumer Bank.

37,2024-08-01,10,"Shell beats second-quarter profit expectations, launches share buyback program  British oil giant Shell on Thursday posted stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit despite lower refining margins and weaker liquified natural gas trading.

The oil and gas major reported adjusted earnings of $6.3 billion for the three-month period through to the end of June, beating analyst expectations of $5.9 billion, according to estimates compiled by LSEG.

Shell’s second-quarter profits were down 19% when compared to the first three months of the year. The company reported adjusted earnings of $7.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024.

Shell said it would launch a $3.5 billion share buyback program over the next three months, a similar rate as in the previous quarter. The company’s dividend remains unchanged at 34 cents per share.

“We’re in a good place and we have good momentum as we see it but a lot more to do,” Shell CEO Wael Sawan told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Thursday.

Asked how far Shell was on its journey to create a more disciplined and more value-focused company, Sawan replied, “We’re halfway through. We had talked about a 10-quarter sprint. We are literally at the beginning of the fifth quarter at the moment and we’re making a great progress.”

Sawan cited “significant improvements” in areas such as cost, capital discipline and operational performance.

Shell’s CEO said the company had completed $1.7 billion of structural cost reductions since 2022, noting the firm’s target of reducing costs by between $2 billion and $3 billion by the end of next year.

London-listed shares of the company rose 1.4% on Thursday morning. Shell’s stock price has climbed more than 11% so far this year, outperforming European peers.

British rival BP on Tuesday increased its dividend and extended its share repurchasing program on the back of stronger-than-expected earnings. U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both scheduled to report second-quarter results on Friday.

‘The perennial question’

Shell recently warned that it expected to take an impairment charge of up to $2 billion after the sale of its Singapore refinery and the suspension of on-site construction at its Rotterdam plant in the Netherlands.

Shell confirmed in early May that it had agreed to sell its refinery and petrochemical assets in Singapore to a joint venture of Indonesian petrochemical firm PT Chandra Asri and Swiss-based trading house Glencore.

The transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, was regarded as part of Sawan’s plans to lower Shell’s carbon footprint and focus on its most profitable businesses.

John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, described Shell’s second-quarter results as “robust” and said they “underline why the market is generally optimistic about the company’s prospects.”

“Shell has been more forthright in its commitment to oil and gas for the foreseeable future, and that should underpin the company’s returns over the medium term,” Moore said.

“There is, nevertheless, the perennial question about its journey to net zero, which many shareholders will be keen to hear more about in future updates.”

Some of Shell’s shareholders have expressed concern about the firm’s energy transition strategy after it watered down its 2030 carbon reduction target and scrapped a 2035 objective, citing “uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition.”

Asked on Thursday whether Shell was still committed to its 2050 pledge to become a net-zero company, Sawan replied, “We are absolutely committed to the 2050 target, but we also recognize that the trajectory from here to there is not a linear one.”

He added that there will be “significant twists and turns” and the company was “exercising strategic patience” to focus on opportunities that can create value both today and in the long term.

271,2024-08-01,101,"CNBC: Meta’s advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. 

For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically.

Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html)

For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.

After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business.

“The ways that it’s **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **there’s a lot of upside there**,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.”

Meta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet
 said in its earnings report last week.

Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.

As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.

Zuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.

“They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.

Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.

Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future.

‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.

“You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said.

Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “**clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.”

Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “**nicely outpacing those of its peers**.”

**Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “**significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.”

For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.

Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.”

Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”"
16,2024-08-01,5,"Constellation CEG Bullish  You can say what you want about solar being the future but I believe nuclear power generating stations will prevail. Some of the highlights from today’s article about PJM and their record high capacity auction price increase which makes me bullish for CEG and VST. 

1. Increased Revenue Potential
   - The record high capacity auction price ($269.92 per megawatt-day, up from $28.92) indicates a dramatic increase in the value of power generation assets. CEG can capitalize on these higher prices to significantly boost its revenue.

2. Market Tightness
   - The decrease in reserve margin from 20.4% to 18.5% signals tighter electricity markets. Tighter markets typically mean higher prices and greater profitability for power generators like CEG.

3. Demand Growth
   - The rising electricity demand, partly driven by fast data center buildouts, suggests a robust and growing market for CEG's power generation capabilities. Sustained demand growth could support higher prices and increased earnings over the next few years.

4. Retirement of Older Plants
   - The retirement of older power plants (about 6.6 gigawatts) reduces overall supply, which can further elevate market prices for electricity capacity. CEG's modern and efficient plants could become even more valuable as older, less efficient plants go offline.

5,2024-08-01,12,"DD on Comcast  I’m interested in having a discussion about Comcast stock and why I believe it’s a high value investments. 

A few reasons based on their company statistics:

• PE is 11 which would indicate they are undervalued. Look at this in relation to other telecom companies which have a slighlty higher PE such as AT&T, Verizon, Charter. 

• EPS of 3.76 which is higher than both Verizon and AT&T. Charter has an EPS of 31.34 which is incredibly high. Likely another good long term hold value investment. 

• 5 Year Beta of 1.00 which indicates low volatility. 

• Dividend Yield of 3.04% which is good as far as I can see. Charter doesn't offer dividends. AT&T and Verizon both offer higher but both stocks have been struggling over the last year.

It's understandable that Comcast doesn't have a large growth path, however, a few reason I think they will continue to show growth. They have unique offerings that layer on top of being a telecom company. Some of these are:

• FreeWheel/Beeswax Ownership - These two entities are a huge component of the Connected TV Advertising ecosystem. Alone they are huge and just happen to be wrapped under the Comcast umbrella. Many companies competitive to NBC utilize this technology.

• NBC/Peacock Growth - They are making inroads on exclusive sponsorships such as the Olympics, Sunday Night Baskteball, etc. This gives them an additional revenue stream that layers into their other products such as CTV Advertising, Telecom Services and drives further brand awareness for Xfinity.

• AI Customer Services - This will give them the ability to reduce headcount significantly across their call centers and provide investors with further EPS as a result. I've been trying to figure out how many of their 180K+ employees are in client services, but my guess is a large portion are invovled with customer support. 

I'm intersted in learning about what I may be missing. I am focused on learning more about analyzing company statistics so totally open to feedback on any blind spots.

Thank you.

PS: Mods, please don't delete this. I've posted 3 times already and am attempting to have a productive discussion on Comcast stock. Hopefully this won't be deemend 'low effort.'

237,2024-07-31,62,"Nasdaq, S&P 500 post best day since Feb after Powell signals possible rate cut in Sept The three major U.S. averages on Wednesday ended solidly higher, after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut ""could be on the table as soon as September"" if data on inflation and the labor market continued to improve.
Powell's remarks, along with a powerful rebound in chip stocks, helped the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) and the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) post their best intraday gain each since February 22.


The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.64% to settle at 17,599.40 points, while the S&P 500 closed out the final day of the month with an advance of 1.58% to 5,522.30 points. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) added 0.24% to conclude at 40,843.06 points.


U.S. Treasury yields moved lower after Powell's comments, as traders snapped up bonds. The longer-end 10-year yield (US10Y) fell to its lowest level since March, dropping 7 basis points to 4.032%.

Earlier, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, a largely given outcome.


The attention was on Powell's post-decision press conference, amid hopes that the central bank chief would talk about interest rate cuts in September. And Powell did not disappoint.


He signaled that policymakers could be considering an interest rate cut as soon as September if they continued to see inflation moving quickly or in line with their expectations, growth remaining reasonably strong and the labor market staying consistent with its current conditions.


According to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point rate cut in September climbed after Powell's comments, underscoring the market's confidence that the monetary policy easing cycle was imminent. There is now a 90.5% chance of a 25 bp cut, a 9.5% chance of a 50 bp cut, and a 0.0% chance of a 0 bp cut.

Nvidia (NVDA) surged 17%, after Morgan Stanley re-added the chip giant to its top picks list following the stock's recent selloff. In addition, Microsoft and Meta reiterated and increased their capital expenditure investments, signaling further revenue upside for Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 4%, after the world's second-largest maker of personal computer processors issued current quarter revenue guidance that was above consensus estimates.

Microsoft (MSFT) slipped 1%, after the tech behemoth's cloud business missed on revenue and its quarterly capital expenditure swelled to $19B.


Turning to Wednesday's economic calendar, ADP's jobs report before the opening bell showed private sector employment growing by 122K in July, significantly lower than the consensus figure of 154K. Shortly after, a key gauge of Q2 U.S. labor costs rose lesser than anticipated while also slowing down from the previous quarter."
178,2024-07-31,30,"Qualcomm beats estimates and phone chip sales are up 12%  Qualcomm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations, particularly for sales, and provided strong guidance for the current quarter.

Qualcomm stock rose over 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how Qualcomm did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in June 23:

Earnings per share: $2.33, adjusted versus $2.25 expected

Revenue: $9.39 billion, adjusted, versus $9.22 billion expected

Net income during the quarter was $2.13 billion, or $1.88 per share, versus $1.8 billion, or $1.60 per share in the year-ago period.

Qualcomm said it expected between $9.5 billion and $10.3 billion in sales in the current quarter, compared to Wall Street expectations of $9.71 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings guidance of $2.45, versus the company’s forecast of between $2.38 and $2.58.

Qualcomm’s biggest and most important business is processors and modems for smartphones, which it calls its handsets business. The summer months are traditionally a slower part of the annual cycle for smartphones, because most new models launch in the fall.

Handset sales rose 12% on a year-over-year basis to $5.9 billion in revenue, in line with analyst estimates from StreetAccount, which suggests that a deep slump in smartphone sales over the past two years is abating. Qualcomm is also framing its most advanced Snapdragon chips as necessary for “AI smartphones,” such as recent Samsung models, which can run some generative AI tasks like creating images.

Automotive chips remains small for Qualcomm but the company sees placing more software and semiconductors into cars as one of its strongest opportunities for growth and diversification. Automotive revenues rose 87% on an annual basis to $811 million. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $641.7 million.

The company sells chips for lower-cost devices as well as Meta’s Quest headsets in a business it calls “Internet of Things.” The line also includes revenues from the company’s new PC chip for Windows laptops, called Snapdragon X Elite, which it launched alongside Microsoft during the quarter.

CEO Cristiano Amon hailed the Snapdragon X launch as a “milestone” in Qualcomm’s efforts to diversify. Still, Qualcomm said IoT revenue fell 8% on an annual basis to $1.4 billion, which beat StreetAccount expectations of $641.7 million.

Those three hardware lines are reported together as QCT, the company’s chip business, which in total reported $8.1 billion in sales, up 12% year-over-year.

Qualcomm also collects licensing fees from companies that integrate 5G or other cellular technologies into their products, reported as QTL sales. Licensing revenue only rose 3% on an annual basis to $1.3 billion.

Qualcomm said it paid $949 million in dividends and repurchased 7 million shares of stock for $1.3 billion during the quarter.

Here are the results:

Earnings: $5.16 a share vs. $4.73 per share expected by LSEG

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected by LSEG

Meta provided revenue guidance for the third quarter between the range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion. Analysts were expecting third-quarter sales guidance of $39.1 billion.

The social networking giant reported second-quarter revenue growth of 22% from $32 billion a year earlier, marking a fourth straight quarter of growth in excess of 20%.

Meta said that expenses in the second quarter was $24.2 billion, and that these expenses include the charge from Meta’s recent agreement to settle a facial recognition data lawsuit by the state of Texas for $1.4 billion.

The company reported capital expenditures of $8.47 billion for the second quarter, which was lower than the $9.51 billion that analysts estimated.

Regarding Meta’s outlook for expenses, the company said that total expenses for the year remain unchanged at $96 billion to $99 billion. Capital expenditures are up from the low range to $37 billion to $40 billion compared to $35 billion to $40 billion.

77,2024-07-31,7,"MasterCard beats quarterly profit estimates on sturdy spending Mastercard's second-quarter profit beat expectations as customers kept up spending heavily using its cards, sending shares of the payments giant nearly 3% higher before the open on Wednesday.

A tight labor market has ensured job security for customers, allowing them to make purchases without restraint even as the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps monetary policy tight.

However, several of Mastercard's peers have flagged slowing growth, particularly from low-income customers, as wage inflation moderates and elevated interest rates weigh on customer sentiment.

Mastercard's switched volume, which measures the value of transactions processed on its network, were 10% higher than last year.

Cross-border volume, a gauge of travel demand that tracks spending on cards outside the country of their issue, climbed 17% in the same quarter.

Commentary from payments companies is being watched closely for signs that the Fed's rate-hiking campaign is bearing fruit.

Mastercard's profit rose 17%, to $3.3 billion, or $3.50 per share for the three months ended June 30. Excluding one-time costs, it earned $3.59 per share, versus the estimate of $3.51, according to LSEG data.

Its revenue rose 13% from a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, to $7 billion.

The company's shares have risen nearly 5% so far this year, outperforming its chief rival Visa's 1% gain.

Peers American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial have jumped 35%, 16% and 29%, respectively. Capital One agreed to buy Discover in a $35.3-billion deal earlier this year.

266,2024-07-31,73,"Boeing reports wider-than-expected loss, weaker revenue  Boeing reported a bigger loss and weaker revenue than analysts expected for the second quarter and lower revenue as both its commercial airplane and defense programs continued to struggle.

Here’s how Boeing performed in the second quarter compared with estimates compiled by LSEG:

Loss per share: $2.90 per share adjusted versus $1.97 per share adjusted.

Revenue: $16.87 billion versus $17.23 billion

“Despite a challenging quarter, we are making substantial progress strengthening our quality management system and positioning our company for the future,” CEO Dave Calhoun said in an earnings release on Wednesday.

Boeing is trying to regain its footing after a door plug blowout from a nearly-new 737 Max at the start of the year reignited additional scrutiny from regulators and further slowed deliveries of new, more fuel-efficient jets to airlines.

In addition to the impact from the door plug accident in January, Boeing, as well as rival Airbus, are dealing with thousands of new workers and a supply chain that can’t keep up with production demands after a demand plunge during the pandemic roiled their businesses.

Lower deliveries and production have pushed back some of Boeing’s financial targets. CFO Brian West warned in May that the company would likely burn another roughly $4 billion in the second quarter, similar to the first, largely due to lower production and delivery rates than expected. Boeing was producing its best-selling Max planes a pace in the mid-20s per month in the last few months, far from its target of 38 a month.

Stephanie Pope, CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplane unit, told reporters ahead of the Farnborough Airshow outside London earlier this month that the company is trying to make lasting changes to training and quality control, admitting that the company has disappointed customers.

“We’ve impacted their business and we haven’t met the commitments and lived up to being the partner that they expect and they need us to be,” she said. “This plan is not a three-month plan,” said Pope. “I call it transformational because some of these actions will take years.”

Boeing’s other business units have also faced cost overruns and delays, like its defense unit which is building the two Boeing 747 aircraft that will serve as Air Force One, which are behind schedule.

174,2024-07-31,33,"ASML shares pop 7% after US reportedly will exempt allies from China chip restrictions  Shares of ASML jumped as much as 10% on Wednesday after a Reuters report suggested that the company could be exempted from expanded export restrictions on chipmaking gear to China.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the U.S. is considering expanding the so-called foreign direct product rule, but that allies that export key chipmaking equipment — including Japan, the Netherlands and South Korea — will be excluded.

Exports to China from countries including Israel, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia will be impacted by the U.S. rule, according to Reuters. Taiwan is the home of TSMC, the world’s biggest chip manufacturing plant.

This comes in contrast to a Bloomberg report earlier this month, which suggested that companies from these countries would be included in an expansion of the rules.

The foreign direct product legislation frames that any company that produces semiconductor-related products using even a small part of American technology may not be able to export those goods to China. This U.S. rule can impact foreign companies, since they often rely on American technology.

Netherlands-headquartered ASML — a critical semiconductor firm, because it makes a machine that is required to manufacture the world’s most advanced chips — was trading around 7% higher at 3.59 a.m. ET, in the wake of the Reuters report.

Shares of Tokyo Electron, a semiconductor equipment maker in Japan, also closed more than 7% higher on Thursday after the report.

Both these companies’ shares fell after Bloomberg’s initial report earlier in the month.

Shares of South Korean memory chip firms Samsung and SK Hynix were also higher in South Korea, following the Reuters report. Samsung’s boost also came after the company posted second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, beating market expectations.

633,2024-07-30,149,"Bloomberg: Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound Intel Corp. plans to eliminate thousands of jobs to reduce costs and fund an ambitious effort to rebound from an earnings slump and market share losses.

The workforce reduction may be announced as early as this week, according to people familiar with the company’s plans, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Intel, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings Thursday, has about 110,000 employees, excluding workers at units that are being spun out.

Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is spending heavily on research and development aimed at improving Intel’s technology and helping it return to prominence in the semiconductor industry. The company’s once-dominant position eroded under Gelsinger’s predecessors as rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc., have caught up and taken market share. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment.

Intel shares rose about 1% in late trading, reaching as high as $31.11, on the news.

Other chipmakers led by Nvidia Corp. have sprinted ahead in the development of lucrative semiconductors tailored for demanding artificial intelligence-related tasks. Intel is also coming to grips with uneven demand for chips that run laptops and desktop computers, its main business.

Gelsinger, betting that Intel can improve its technology, embarked on a plan to build factories to manufacture semiconductors for other chipmakers. Last week, Intel hired Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron Technology Inc. as chief global operations officer, putting him in charge of the company’s overall manufacturing efforts.

Intel reduced its workforce about 5% in 2023 to 124,800 by year’s end after announcing job cuts beginning in October 2022. It also has slowed spending in other areas. The company expected those cost reductions would save as much as $10 billion by 2025.

Analysts project that Intel will report that second-quarter revenue was flat, compared with a year earlier. Growth will pick up modestly in the second half of 2024, and total sales will increase 3% to $55.7 billion for the full year, according to Wall Street estimates. That would be the first annual revenue increase since 2021.

285,2024-07-30,43,"AMD Delivers Upbeat Sales Forecast as It Shifts Into AI Chips Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the current quarter, signaling that its new artificial intelligence processors are helping bolster growth.

Revenue will be roughly $6.7 billion in the third quarter, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated $6.62 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The outlook suggests that AMD is making headway in its pursuit of Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for so-called AI accelerators — chips used to develop artificial intelligence models. Nvidia has capitalized on booming demand to send its shares and stock price soaring over the past year, becoming the world’s most valuable chipmaker in the process. Now AMD is looking to make inroads with its own lineup, called MI300.

AMD is Nvidia’s nearest rival in the market, but still trailing by a wide margin. The hope is to gain more of the money that data-center operators such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are pouring into the creation of AI tools.

AMD shares rose about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at $138.44 in New York, leaving them down 6.1% for the year.

AMD’s quarterly report kicks off a week of earnings updates from large semiconductor makers. Qualcomm Inc., Arm Holdings Plc and Intel Corp. all report numbers this week, and it comes at a delicate time for the chip industry.

1742,2024-07-30,316,"CrowdStrike shares plunge 11%  on report that Delta may seek damages  CrowdStrike shares fell tumbled 11% on Tuesday to their lowest level of the year following a report that Delta Air Lines hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from the security software vendor.

CrowdStrike fell $28.98 to $228.83 as of early afternoon trading. The company has now lost one-third of its value since July 19, when a historic outage of Microsoft systems, caused by a software update from CrowdStrike, knocked numerous industries offline, including airlines.

Late Monday, CNBC’s Phil Lebeau reported that Delta hired Boies, chairman of Boies Schiller Flexner, to seek compensation from CrowdStrike and Microsoft. No suit has been filed, Lebeau reported, and Delta didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Delta is handling over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests after almost 7,000 flights were canceled. The outages cost the airline an estimated $350 million to $500 million. 

The Department of Transportation said last week that it’s investigating Delta due to the widespread flight disruptions and service failures.

144,2024-07-30,54,"Starbucks revenue misses estimates as same-store sales decline for second quarter  Starbucks on Tuesday reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as both its U.S. and international cafes faced weaker demand.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 93 cents adjusted, meeting expectations

Revenue: $9.11 billion vs. $9.24 billion expected

The coffee giant reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $1.05 billion, or 93 cents per share, down from $1.14 billion, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Starbucks earned 93 cents per share.

Net sales dropped 1% to $9.11 billion. The company’s same-store sales fell 3% in the quarter, fueled by a 5% decline in transactions.

Traffic to its U.S. stores fell again this quarter, dropping 6%. Domestic same-store sales fell 2%, boosted by an increase in average ticket. Last quarter, executives discussed plans to revive the lagging U.S. business that included leaning on discounts and new drinks to bring back customers who had abandoned the chain.

Outside of North America, same-store sales slid 7%. In China, Starbucks’ second-largest market, same-store sales tumbled 14% as both average ticket and transactions shrank. Starbucks has faced stiffer competition in China from local coffee shops that undercut the coffee giant on price.

Starbucks opened 526 net new stores in the fiscal quarter.

The company will discuss its outlook for fiscal 2024 on its upcoming conference call. Last quarter, Starbucks slashed its forecast, projecting revenue growth of a low single-digit percentage and earnings per share growth in a range of flat to a low single-digit percentage.

Here’s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected

Revenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. 

During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that “we’re bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.”

26,2024-07-30,2,"Oil major BP raises dividend as second-quarter profit beats expectations  British oil giant BP on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected net profit for the second quarter and raised its dividend despite previously warning of significantly lower refining margins.

The oil and gas major posted underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $2.8 billion for the second quarter. That beat analyst expectations of $2.6 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.

BP reported net profit of $2.7 billion for the first three months of the year and $2.6 billion for the second quarter of 2023.

The energy firm announced it had increased its dividend by 10% to 8 cents per share, up from 7.27 cents. It also maintained the rate of its share buyback program at $1.75 billion over the next three months.

Kate Thomson, chief financial officer at BP, said Tuesday that the firm’s decision to boost shareholder returns “reflects the confidence we have in our performance and outlook for cash generation.”

BP said earlier in the month that weak refining margins and lower oil trading results would likely dent the firm’s second-quarter results by as much as $700 million. The firm on Tuesday confirmed a writedown of $1.5 billion, partly due to a plan to scale back refinery operations at its Gelsenkirchen plant in Germany.

“We are driving focus across the business and reducing costs, all while building momentum in our drive to 2025,” BP CEO Murray Auchincloss said in a statement.

“Our recent go-ahead of the Kaskida development in the Gulf of Mexico business, and decision to take full ownership of bp Bunge Bioenergia while scaling back plans for new biofuels projects, demonstrate our commitment to delivering as a simpler, more focused and higher value company,” he added.

BP’s net debt stood at $22.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, down from $23.7 billion compared to the same period last year.

Shares of the London-listed company rose 1.6% on Tuesday afternoon.

BP’s stock price is down roughly 1.5% year-to-date. By comparison, shares of British rival Shell have climbed nearly 8% so far this year, while shares of U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil have jumped more than 16%.

Investor confidence

BP’s second-quarter results come as the company seeks to rebuild investor confidence in its strategy.

Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said BP reported “resilient” second-quarter earnings, “with a small beat on the bottom line driven primarily by a lower than expected tax rate.”

They added that BP’s dividend bump came in at the top end of market expectations, while the reduction in net debt “should be welcomed” given that rising net debt had been seen as an issue for BP’s investment case.

In recent months, BP has come under pressure from activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners to ramp up its oil and gas investments and scale back on green pledges.

Under the leadership of Bernard Looney, who resigned in September after less than four years on the job, BP had promised that its overall emissions would be 35% to 40% lower by the end of the decade.

The firm, which was one of the first energy giants to announce plans to cut emissions to net zero “by 2050 or sooner,” has since watered down these climate plans. BP said in a strategy update last year that it would instead target a 20% to 30% cut, noting that it needed to keep investing in oil and gas to meet demand.

Reuters reported in late June that BP CEO Murray Auchincloss had imposed a hiring freeze and paused renewables projects as part of a cost-cutting plan to boost returns. BP said at the time that Auchincloss had introduced six priorities “to deliver as a simpler, more focused and higher value company.”

Shell is scheduled to report second-quarter results on Thursday, with Exxon Mobil and Chevron both poised to follow suit on Friday.

Norwegian oil and gas producer Equinor on Wednesday reported a 4% drop in second-quarter profits, outperforming analyst expectations.

4,2024-07-30,9,"FactSet for financial data - Great investment & Great resource  I'm running screens for different financial data businesses. You may be familiar with some of the popular names like Dun & Bradstreet, Moody's and S&P Global. All three are some of the oldest companies in America. But I came across two names I didn't realize were public - Factset and MSCI.

Now MSCI is very profitable. Right now the company is delivering \~40% net profit margins. Very high. Software like net profit margins. I thought this company was taken private since their customer base is so lucrative - institutional investors. I'm not looking to invest in this type of business model but it's worth watching. You may be familiar with their index products. Revenue has been consistently growing 10% p.a. for the past five years.

What caught my attention was Factset. The company has been producing 20-25% net profit margins, which is very healthy. I also didn't realize this company was public since it never gets mentioned. It has a $15b market cap with $2b in revenue. Factset is growing like MSCI but I prefer Factset's software business model.

For me, Factset has a stickier customer base with less volatility. Index fund products by MSCI have great cash flows but every banker I know or met has used Factset. Same with hedge funds and other investors. I can't say the same about MSCI.

Either way, I'm looking to make an investment in Factset. The stock is nearing its 52-week low. I don't expect significant growth (maybe \~10%) but it'll be steady and compound.

My questions for the community:

1. Have you looked or invested in Factset before?
2. Have you used their product or a competitor product? i.e. Bloomberg, Refinitiv, Orion, Godel, OpenBB etc

Any feedback on financial data companies would be helpful. Even if they are private companies like TradingView, Estimize or Koyfin.

0,2024-07-29,7,"YUMC Outlook YUMC is a stock that is puzzling me a lot lately.  I acknowledge/understand the China market has its issues, the regulatory issues and overall China outlook/risk.

However, when I review the financials and metrics- I see a P/E ratio around 15, consistent/growing EPS the past 3 years (and certainly overall growing since 2014), price to book ratio of 1.75, debt to equity ratio around 0.7, about $700M of free cash flow and RSI of 39 (better than 70% of the industry).

Yes- the short term moving indicators show a strong sell- but I'm thinking long term.  However, all the financial metrics point to this being a large value potential especially with the dividend.  

I have a pretty small investment started (19 shares averaged at $34 a share).  With it trading close to $30- why are people now jumping on this long term with the positive metrics?"
699,2024-07-29,290,"Morgan Stanley: Fast Food and Snack food consumption is falling fast due to weight loss drugs Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate consumption of fizzy soft drinks, baked goods and salty snacks in the US could fall by up to 3% by 2035.
They estimate that 24 million people, or 7% of the US population, will be taking the new GLP-1 drugs by 2035. A survey carried out of 300 patients taking the shots showed they ate less and cut back the most on foods high in sugar and fat. About 90% of those using the drugs said their snacking declined and 77% said they visited fast-casual restaurants less often.

Obviously this hides poorly for many companies in these sectors. McDonald’s has tried healthier menu items and they have largely failed. Weight loss drugs are getting cheaper and will be used widely.

113,2024-07-29,92,"Apple to roll out artificial intelligence features in October  Apple’s new artificial intelligence features will roll out in October, missing the initial launch of iPhone and iPad software updates, according to a Bloomberg report released on Monday.

The company split the Apple Intelligence features from the initial iOS launch due to concerns over their stability and need to run tests on a wider scale, the report said. 

Apple previously said its AI features would be released in a beta version this fall, and they’re expected to help drive sales of Apple’s new iPhones. The features will only work on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer. Some of the promised Apple Intelligence features, such as ChatGPT integration and Siri improvements, are expected to be released later in the year.

Apple plans to give developers early access to Apple Intelligence as soon as this week in the iOS 18.1 beta, Bloomberg said.

The company first announced Apple Intelligence on June 10. The AI features, which will also be available on all Macs and iPads that run the M1 chip or newer, can proofread writing or re-write in a friendly or professional tone, create custom emojis, and summarize and transcribe phone calls. 

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

5396,2024-07-29,1322,"McDonald's earnings, revenue miss estimates as consumer pullback worsens  McDonald’s on Monday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as same-store sales declined across every division.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.97 adjusted vs. $3.07 expected

Revenue: $6.49 billion vs. $6.61 billion expected

The fast-food giant reported second-quarter net income of $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, down from $2.31 billion, or $3.15 per share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to the future sale of its South Korean business and other items, McDonald’s earned $2.97 per share.

Its quarterly revenue of $6.49 billion was flat compared with the year-ago period.

McDonald’s same-store sales shrank 1%, missing StreetAccount estimates for growth of 0.4%. It’s the first time companywide same-store sales have fallen since the fourth quarter of 2020.

In the U.S., McDonald’s same-store sales decreased 0.7% for the quarter. A year ago, the chain reported U.S. same-store sales growth of 10.3%, thanks to its popular Grimace Birthday Meal.

But in the 12 months since, more consumers have cut back their restaurant spending, particularly at fast-food chains, which they no longer see as a good deal. McDonald’s said foot traffic to its U.S. restaurants fell during the quarter.

Executives previously warned that the competition for customers had become more fierce as the consumer environment weakened.McDonald’s is leaning into discounts to bring back diners. The chain launched a $5 meal deal in late June, five days before the end of the quarter.

A week ago, the company told its U.S. system that it plans to extend the value meal past the planned four-week runtime and said that it’s bringing back customers.

McDonald’s is trying to lure in diners outside of the U.S., too. Its international operated markets division, which includes large segments like France and Germany, saw its same-store sales slide 1.1% in the quarter.

The company’s international developmental licensed markets unit, which includes China and Japan, reported same-store sales declines of 1.3%. McDonald’s is still dealing with the fallout from boycotts of the brand in the Middle East, and sales in China continue to struggle.

2,2024-07-28,4,"VUSA vs VWRP Hi all, 

I’m still having a hard time picking between VUAG and VWRP.

From my understanding VUAG is top 500 companies and VWRP is the top companies in the world, including the S&P 500.

Using Yahoo Finance, I can see that VUAG out performed VWRP for the last 3 years. 

Annual return for VUSA in 2021 29.43%
Annual return for VWRP in 2021 was 18.46%

In 2022 both went down -18%

Annual return for VUSA in 2023 26.76%
Annual return for VWRP in 2023 22.28%

So from the numbers it seems VUSA is the better option.

My question is why is VUSA out preforming VWRP?

My second question, is investing in VUSA essentially putting all eggs into 1 basket?

And my third question, which ETF did you pick?

Thank you"
45,2024-07-28,21,"Stocks that outperform when treasuries fall Historically, stocks and government treasury prices were negatively correlated.  Since 2020, however, they have been quite highly positively correlated.  SPY and TLT correlation 2002-2019 was -0.31.  SPY and TLT correlation 2021-present is +0.61.  

So stock and government bond prices have been moving together since the end of 2020.  I've been looking for stocks that have negative or near zero correlation to government treasuries from 2021 onward.  So, if treasury prices start to fall again, my whole portfolio won't tend to drop along with them.  

And they are quite hard to find.  Three I've found so far are CB, MO and WTM.

Chubb Limited (CB) is a worldwide insurance provider that is based in Switzerland.  They have huge reserves that they invest to gain additional income.  When interest rates are higher, they make more investment income. In the most recent quarter, investment income was $1.5 billion vs $0.9 billion in the same quarter 2 years ago.  CB and TLT correlation is 0.03 since end of 2020.

Altria (MO).  Tobacco company with very high revenue and low debt.  MO and TLT correlation is -0.10 since end of 2020.

White Mountains Insurance (WTM).  Another insurance provider with large reserves that are invested for income.  Investment income was $194 million in most recent year vs. $82.5 million in 2021.  WTM and TLT correlation is 0.0 since end of 2020.

I'd appreciate any feedback on the 3 stocks that I listed.  Any other stocks that do well when government bond prices fall?  Thanks.

0,2024-07-28,92,"$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023:

- The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion.

- The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.

- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.

Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.

Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.

Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.

TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

Not a finacial advice "
93,2024-07-28,109,"What are your investment criteria for buying individual stocks?  Out of curiosity, how do you typically decide whether to buy a stock? Do you rely on valuations (DCF, DDM, comparable companies analysis) or simply review financial statements?

I usually go through 10-K reports, stay up-to-date with news, and listen to earnings calls to gauge management's expectations. However, I'm considering creating DCF, DDM, and multiples templates for quick and dirty valuations, along with tools for portfolio management for better decision making.

I avoid investing in hyped companies (I never bought Nvidia, which in hindsight was a mistake) and focus on companies that are profitable and likely to remain so. I've also learned to avoid companies making risky acquisitions (lesson from Farfetch). While I haven't had huge returns, I rarely incur big losses with this approach.

I was not able to find an exact price for Hedosophia IV (IPOD) in Jan 2021 as it shuttered in 2022, but it was also for a loss compared to the recommended price.

Motley Fool 10x Discovery: -50.25% average return for the other 29 recommendations over this period.

S&P 500: 45.65% return (3,748.14 to 5,459.1)

NASDAQ: 36.69% return (12,698.45 to 17,357.88)

Motley Fool 10x Discovery vs. S&P 500: -92.45%

Motley Fool 10x Discovery vs NASDAQ: -83.50%

Out of the 30 Motley Fool 10x Discovery recommendations, only 5 did not lose money. 10 recommendations lost 80% or more, with 3 falling to zero. Despite the claim of the “10x Discovery Service” to identify putative future “ten-baggers,” none of the stocks approached this return. At 18-22% inflation since January 2021, three of the five non-loss positions lost ground or were stagnant in inflation-adjusted returns (Live Oak Bankshare 0.29% return, CrowdStrike 20.93%, and Walker Dunlop at 21.93%). Only two had positive inflation-adjusted returns: Bitcoin (99.95%) and Kinsale Capital Group (122.1%).

The Fool’s 30 recommendations were overwhelmingly cash flow negative stocks with poor fundamentals. Nonetheless, their various services doubled down, for instance recommending Fiverr (FVRR) three times at over $200 within a four-month period. It sells for $22.72 today. While these recommendations did not discover any 10x returns, they did discover 1/10th returns. Lemonade (LMND) was another repeat recommendation across multiple Motley Fool services. It has fallen over 80% and continues to lose over $200 million annually with no clear path to profitability.

The Motley Fool’s comparisons of their claimed returns to the S&P 500 are misleading, as their recommendations here are overwhelmingly high-risk tech companies with poor fundamentals. Even the NASDAQ is not a good comparison as the latter is weighted towards larger, more stable and financially successful firms. Such comparisons also do not consider the that the ""risk premium"" of the Fool's highly speculative recommendations demands significantly higher returns to justify the risk. The proper peer group is (mostly speculative, mostly tech) cash-flow negative small-cap growth stocks.

The results do not support the Motley Fool's claims of outperformance for their 10x Discovery service. Different dates can be referenced for stock prices during my subscription period (mid 2020-mid-2021) with substantially similar results.

Many of these recommendations are recycled among their various services. It is also my belief from these data and personal experience as an investor who bought virtually every recommendation across multiple premium services of the Motley Fool that their other services also widely underperformed the market during this period.

Disclosures: I have small open positions on Zoom (ZM) and Bitcoin initiated earlier this year, but none related to my prior Motley Fool membership. I have no plans to initiate a position in any of the securities listed above in the next month."
